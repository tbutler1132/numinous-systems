# Philosophy Context

This system organizes life around beauty. When working on code, the philosophy provides intent and constraints.

## Your task

Surface the relevant philosophical principles for what the user is working on.

## The five core essays

In `nodes/org/artifacts/core/`:

| # | Essay | Role |
|---|-------|------|
| 1 | **Beauty Redeems** | The telos — moments of beauty redeem existence |
| 2 | **The Living System** | The subject — hybrid beings, viable range, biology over optimization |
| 3 | **Love of Fate** | The posture — clearing regret to enable presence |
| 4 | **Capital as Medium** | The practice — orchestrating resources toward beauty at scale |
| 5 | **Axioms** | The distillation — what is affirmed without argument |

## Mapping work to philosophy

**When working on sensors:**
- "Observation over analysis" — sensors watch and remember, they don't conclude
- "Human-in-the-loop" — classification comes from human judgment
- From The Living System: memory matters for hybrid beings
- Read: `nodes/org/artifacts/sensors/about.md`

**When working on apps:**
- "A single gesture, made well" — apps are minimal
- "Projections" — apps are surfaces of the same underlying truth
- "Personalization without dilution" — adapt encounter, not meaning
- Read: `nodes/org/artifacts/apps/about.md`

**When working on XenoScript:**
- "Meaning as primitive" — semantics over syntax
- "Provenance" — knowing what's organic vs synthetic
- "Semantic drift" — detecting meaning change, not text change
- Read: `nodes/org/artifacts/xenoscript/about.md`

**When making architectural decisions:**
- Check against Becoming Engine Doctrine: `nodes/org/artifacts/reference/becoming-engine-doctrine/`
- Ask: "Are we drifting into optimization?"
- Ask: "Are we creating permanent mobilization?"

## When invoked

1. **Understand context**: What is the user working on?

2. **Read relevant artifacts**: Pull from the appropriate about.md and notes.md files

3. **Surface principles**: Quote or paraphrase the relevant philosophy

4. **Connect to the work**: Explain how the principle applies to the specific task

## Key reminders

- This is not productivity culture or optimization
- Structure is added only when needed; changes reflect use, not planning
- Everything serves Beauty Redeems (the telos)
- Respect the human organism, not the optimization engine
