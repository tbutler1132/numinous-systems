# Contributing

This project is early. The ideas are still forming. The structure is provisional.

That said, participation is welcome. The project's thesis includes community not as an afterthought, but as part of what makes things work. So if you want to engage, the door is open.

## What makes sense at this stage

- **Feedback on ideas** — Open an issue or start a discussion. Point out contradictions, missing pieces, or connections I haven't seen.
- **Small clarifications** — Typos, unclear phrasing, broken links. These are always welcome.
- **Your own perspective** — If something here resonates and you want to respond to it, that's interesting. Open a discussion or PR with your thoughts.

## What probably doesn't make sense yet

- Large structural changes or reorganizations
- Adding new frameworks, tooling, or automation
- Contributions that assume the project's direction is settled

## How decisions get made

I'll consider any PR, but this is starting as a personal project with a specific direction. I may say no to things that don't fit, even if they're good ideas in isolation.

If you're unsure whether something would be welcome, open an issue first.

## Running your own node

The `nodes/personal/` directory is gitignored — that's my private working space. If you want to create your own personal node to work alongside the project:

1. Create a `nodes/personal/` directory (it will be ignored by git)
2. Add a `models.md` file for your working assumptions and operational baseline
3. Adapt it for your own use

This is optional. The project is readable without it.
