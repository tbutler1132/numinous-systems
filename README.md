# Numinous Systems

For the conceptual overview, see [ABOUT.md](ABOUT.md).

## Structure

This repository is the **canonical representation** of the project. Everything else — apps, rendered docs, tools — is a projection or process that derives from it.

### Core Artifacts

The core ideas are developed in `nodes/org/artifacts/core/`. Start with:

- **Beauty Redeems** — the telos (why any of this matters)
- **The Living System** — the systems foundation (living systems inside mechanized environments)
- **Love of Fate** — the posture (presence requires closing the question of regret)
- **Capital as Medium** — the method (creation at scale is capital orchestration)
- **Axioms** — the starting points (what is affirmed without argument)

See `nodes/org/artifacts/artifacts.md` for the full structure.

### Organization

The repo is structured around a simple loop:

- Logs record events and actions
- Feedback captures relevant signals
- Models describe current assumptions
- Artifacts are durable outputs

Apps like [Expressions](nodes/org/artifacts/apps/expressions/) are operational projections — they render or transform the canon for specific purposes. Sensors ingest external data into observations. Neither creates truth; they propose or display it.

Structure is added only when needed. Changes reflect use rather than planning.
