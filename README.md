# Vital Systems

This repository documents a creative and philosophical project oriented toward a single purpose: **creating conditions for moments of beauty**.

It is not a product, platform, or framework.
It is a way of working and thinking—recorded as it develops.

## Artifacts

The core ideas are developed in `nodes/org/artifacts/core/`. Start with:

- **Beauty Redeems** — the telos (why any of this matters)
- **The Living System** — the systems foundation (living systems inside mechanized environments)
- **Axioms** — the starting points (what is affirmed without argument)

See `nodes/org/artifacts/artifacts.md` for the full structure.

## How to Read This Repo

The structure follows a feedback loop: sense what's happening, update assumptions, act.

- **Logs** — record events and actions
- **Feedback** — capture relevant signals
- **Models** — describe current assumptions
- **Artifacts** — durable outputs

Each **Node** (person, org, project) runs this loop independently. The longer-term aim is a distributed network of such nodes—coordinating through signals rather than feeds, preserving agency rather than optimizing engagement.

Structure is added only when needed.
Changes reflect use rather than planning.
