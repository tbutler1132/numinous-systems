# Vital Systems

This repository records an ongoing experiment in treating creative and organizational work as a system that adapts through feedback over time.

It is not a product, platform, or framework.
It documents a way of working.

## Primary Artifact

The main public artifact is an essay titled **[[vital-systems-v1|Vital Systems]]**, located in `nodes/org/artifacts/1-vital-systems/`.

That folder contains:

- a README describing the purpose of the text
- one or more versions of the essay
- notes preserving context and intent

## How to Read This Repo

This repository is structured around a simple loop:

- Logs record events and actions
- Feedback captures relevant signals
- Models describe current assumptions
- Artifacts are durable outputs

Structure is added only when needed.
Changes reflect use rather than planning.

This repository may evolve.
Nothing here is assumed to be final.
