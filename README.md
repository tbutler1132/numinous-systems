# Vital Systems

This repository documents a creative and philosophical project oriented toward a single purpose: **creating conditions for moments of beauty**.

It is not a product, platform, or framework.
It is a way of working and thinking, recorded as it develops.

## Artifacts

The core ideas are developed in `nodes/org/artifacts/core/`. Start with:

- **Beauty Redeems** — the telos (why any of this matters)
- **The Living System** — the systems foundation (living systems inside mechanized environments)
- **Love of Fate** — the posture (presence requires closing the question of regret)
- **Capital as Medium** — the method (creation at scale is capital orchestration)
- **Axioms** — the starting points (what is affirmed without argument)

See `nodes/org/artifacts/artifacts.md` for the full structure.

## How to Read This Repo

This repository is structured around a simple loop:

- Logs record events and actions
- Feedback captures relevant signals
- Models describe current assumptions
- Artifacts are durable outputs

Structure is added only when needed.
Changes reflect use rather than planning.

This repository may evolve.
Nothing here is assumed to be final.
