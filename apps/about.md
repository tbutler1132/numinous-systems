# About Apps

Apps are where abstraction becomes encounter.

The system holds ideas, patterns, observations. But ideas do not live in databases. They live when someone meets them—when form becomes experience.

## Why Apps Exist

A sensor ingests. A node organizes. An app *presents*.

Apps are the surface where the system touches the world. They translate internal structure into something that can be seen, felt, navigated. Without apps, the work remains latent—present but unexperienced.

## What Makes an App

An app is not a container of features. It is a *projection*—a particular way of encountering what the system knows.

Each app answers a question:
- What does it feel like to arrive here?
- What does this material want to become when someone sees it?
- How does meaning become presence?

## The Relationship to Artifacts

Apps live here. Their narrative documentation lives in `nodes/org/artifacts/`.

This is deliberate. The *what* and *why* belong to the conceptual layer. The *how*—the deployable code—belongs here. Apps consume artifact content; they do not duplicate it.

## Current Apps

Apps emerge as needs crystallize. What exists now:

- **landing** — The threshold. Where someone first encounters the work.
- **expressions** — Personalized philosophical artifacts. Ideas made specific.
- **projection** — Views into the system's structure.

## Building an App

Build the smallest thing that answers the core question. An app is not a product roadmap. It is a single gesture, made well.
