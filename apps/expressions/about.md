# Expressions

Personalized engagement with philosophical artifacts.

## What It Is

Expressions bridges the gap between canonical artifacts and individual readers. It takes stable ideas and generates personalized expressions tailored to a reader's sensibility, background, and preferences.

The same concept resonates differently with different people. This app enables that resonance without fragmenting the source into incoherence.

## Artifact Documentation

See [nodes/org/artifacts/apps/expressions](../../nodes/org/artifacts/apps/expressions/about.md) for the full conceptual documentation: what questions this addresses, what it is not, and how it connects to the broader project.

## Technical Details

See [README.md](README.md) for stack, local development, deployment, and architecture.
