# Landing

The threshold. Where someone first encounters the work.

## What It Is

A minimal hub and entry point. It presents identity and provides pathways to other artifacts.

The landing page is the front door. It shows only what matters, with restraint and beauty.

## Artifact Documentation

See [nodes/org/artifacts/apps/landing](../../nodes/org/artifacts/apps/landing/about.md) for the full conceptual documentation: design principles and what this is not.
