# Projection

A navigable interface for exploring the system's canon.

## What It Is

Projection renders the repository as a readable, beautiful whole. It covers everything: artifacts, ontology, infrastructure, philosophy. But it presents through the org's interpretation, curation, and aesthetic.

The repo is canon. This app is a view of it, authored and bounded.

## Status

Concept phase. The idea is locked in; implementation has not begun.

## Artifact Documentation

See [nodes/org/artifacts/apps/projection](../../nodes/org/artifacts/apps/projection/about.md) for the full conceptual documentation: what this is and is not, the authorship distinction, and design principles.
