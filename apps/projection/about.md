# Projection

The layered experience of the work.

## What It Is

Projection is how someone encounters the creative work — not an explanation of the system, but the art itself rendered beautifully.

It has depth. The surface is pure experience: finished songs, cover art, atmosphere. Deeper layers reveal context, process, and eventually the raw source. You can stay at the surface and just listen, or descend to see how things are made.

The repo is canon. This app is the authored, curated view of it — optimized for experiencing, not just understanding.

## Status

Concept phase. Implementation scaffolding exists; the real experience does not yet.

## Artifact Documentation

See [nodes/org/artifacts/apps/projection](../../nodes/org/artifacts/apps/projection/about.md) for the full conceptual documentation: the layered model, design principles, and how this evolved.
