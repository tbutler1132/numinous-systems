It presents the identity (currently Timothy Butler as stand-in for org brand) and provides pathways to other artifacts.\n\n## What This Artifact IS\n\n- The front door to the public presence\n- A minimal, elegant hub linking to projects\n- The canonical location for personal/org brand identity\n\n## What This Artifact Is NOT\n\n- A portfolio with extensive content\n- A blog or content platform\n- An app with complex functionality\n\n## Design Principles\n\n- **Restraint** — show only what matters\n- **Beauty** — the first impression should resonate\n- **Navigation** — clear pathways to actual work\n\n## Status\n\nThis artifact is active. The landing page is live and will evolve as new projects are added.",
