# About Nodes

Nodes emerge from necessity, not design.

When feedback from one context begins to interfere with another, a boundary forms. That boundary is a Node.

## Why Nodes Exist

A single undifferentiated system cannot learn well. Signals get mixed. Feedback meant for one purpose distorts another. Memory becomes tangled.

Nodes solve this by creating separation. Each Node learns within its own boundary, accumulating memory and updating models without contaminating others.

## When to Create a Node

Create a Node when:

- feedback from one domain should not influence another
- distinct baselines need to be maintained
- learning in one area has begun to interfere with learning in another

Do not create a Node:

- to organize or categorize
- to represent temporary states
- when a simpler boundary (a tag, a folder) would suffice

## The Shape of a Node

A Node has no prescribed structure. It may contain documents, sub-nodes, processes, or nothing at all.

What defines a Node is not its contents but its boundary: the scope within which its memory, feedback, and regulation apply.

## Interrelation

Nodes are distinct but not isolated. They may reference each other, share context, or participate in larger systems.

The boundaries between Nodes are permeable where useful and firm where necessary.
