Raw notes. Process regularly.

---

- This is the best thing I could ever remeber, Ill always remember
- Ear meal reuben
- I dont want to go to bed
- artifact idea
- Maybe combine lone genius and capital orchestration actually
- Like the idea of Processing Notes. Like, go through the log and do something with every note. Whether make it an action, store it somehow etc
- Weekly gathering is still quite valid. As a starting point.[episode]
  - Good way for me to practice + bootstrap the community
- For example for "Figure out hiring creative director", could definitely formalize this a little more and make it an experiment. Same with everything else: Find writing cadenece, test feel of posting somewhere
- Have concept + notes, allow people to synthesize into an essay based on their own preferences..
  - Fine tune it
- Some signifier like "Unaltered" version
  - unenhanced
  - biological
  - organic
- Expressions app spec fleshed out (artifact 10)
  - No auth, bounded artifact set, ~2 generations per artifact max
  - Display in UI with optional download
  - ~$0.50-0.60 per fully-engaged user with high-tier model — worth it
- **Next: Figure out artifact curation for Expressions**
  - Don't need to restructure existing artifacts, but need to decide:
    - Which artifacts go into the app (contained, complete set)
    - What order/sequence creates a coherent narrative journey
    - Maybe a "recommended path" vs. freeform exploration?
  - The artifacts exist; the question is how to present them as a unified experience
  - This is curatorial work, not restructuring
  - I should store all generated expressions and maybe make a "Machinic" canonical version that integrates all of them
  - Should I integrate more personal details into it?
  - Working on a site...
    - Prob don't need to get cute and can just use React
    - Definitely need to refine the artifacts themselves
    - Maybe include the concept upfront
    - Allow people to view "organics" where they can see notes (notes themselves also need to be refined)
      - Would be a toggle prob
        - Maybe make the design become like earthy when toggled
    - Should probably ask their questions upfront instead of per artifact
    - One regeneration would be fine
    - Add cooler transitions, definitely visuals but maybe even audio
- Maybe should do a weekly dedicated retro for improving system if at all
- Thinking about software as a medium for legibility
  - Software encodes things—takes fuzzy/tacit knowledge and makes it legible, explicit, enforceable
  - This is why the project starts markdown-only: prose is exploration, remains fluid
  - Code comes later, when something is ready to become law
  - The progression: fuzzy → legible → encoded → enforced
  - This isn't accidental bureaucratization—it's _intentional crystallization_
  - You choose when to harden something into code based on when it should become law
  - The encoding power of software can be directed toward beauty (not just efficiency/extraction)
  - This might connect to or extend Vital Systems—or become its own artifact (Software as Law? Code as Medium?)
  - The LLM moment makes this visible: suddenly everyone is thinking about what software _is_, what encoding _means_
  - Open question: what's the relationship between legibility and beauty? Does encoding clarify or kill?
  - Refinement: the danger isn't encoding itself—it's encoding too fast, without thought
  - LLMs accelerate code production; if you're not deliberate, you lock in at lightspeed
  - The encoding power is neutral; the question is whether you're choosing the moment of crystallization or just letting it happen
  - This is why "smallest next thing" matters: velocity with deliberation, not velocity alone
- Deleted Vital Systems v1 essay. Not close to quality standard quite frankly.
- Didn't remove writing tone model, but made its status "low". Reason is I am thinking it may be better to just write some pieces and have those for reference, rather than trying to force writing style. On the other hand it is sort of a "meta" part of the experiment so may not want to delete it completely
  - Pros:
    - Embraces AI as a sort of "artistic" medium by pushing in: Instead of just asking to write, defining the tone, iterating on prompting, etc
    - The repository + agents _is_ the medium
    - Can apply the same level of effort just "higher up the stack"
  - Cons:
    - Can be immediately noticeable and disqualifying in some ways
  - Either way, it would require some sort of external "human" voice, whether that be purely verbal, or through music.
- Think I should focus more on building brand under my name "Timothy Butler", just to tie it to a real person
- Added a bunch of new artifacts ideas
- Contemplating best way to begin external feedback loops
- If the first artifact is published, how should it be amplified?
- No obvious audience for this work; constraint noted
- First draft of Vital Systems essay written; revised for sentence rhythm
- Updated Writing Tone model: sentence length should vary for rhythm
- Think that I should do some video logs to create a more personal effect
  - Maybe do a couple practice ones first before publishing
- Thinking maybe do the legit 1 week stabilization trial down south in Feb
- Then I can go back to Montreal in March for an "elevated" experience
- Move to Montreal as a fall back
  - Maybe do a full month in April. Or week in March month in May
  - Need to start learning French
- Hard focus on in person interactions and brand building
- Need to come up with social exposure plan for next week
- Habits
  - Wake up at 7:30 and workout
  - Wear nice clothes
  - Nightly routine
    - Learn French I guess?
  - Diet
  - Creative routine
- Wardrobe
