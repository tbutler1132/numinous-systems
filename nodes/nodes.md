# Nodes

(Cells within cells interlinked)

A **Node** is a boundary within which feedback, memory, and regulation apply.

Nodes can represent people, organizations, projects, processes, concepts, or any other entity that persists over time and benefits from learning from feedback.

Nodes are not users, roles, or containers.
They do not imply ownership or hierarchy.

Each Node:

- maintains its own baseline
- accumulates its own memory
- receives distinct feedback
- updates its own models

Nodes exist because separating them increases clarity and learning.
They are created only when that separation becomes necessary.

This directory contains all Nodes currently instantiated in the system.
