# Org Node

This directory represents the **Org Node**.

The Org Node is a public, durable entity responsible for:

- producing artifacts
- holding doctrine
- maintaining continuity over time

It is not a proxy for any individual.
Humans may operate this Node, but the Node persists beyond any one operator.

## Files

- `baseline.md`  
  Describes what is normal for the Org when nothing special is happening.

- `log.md`  
  A chronological record of what actually happens.
  This is the primary writing surface.

- `feedback.md`  
  Signals from reality that the Org should not ignore.
  Feedback is recorded without interpretation.

- `models.md`  
  Assumptions, patterns, and learned models that currently guide action.
  All models are provisional and revisable.

## Operating principle

Actions are attributed to the Node whose trajectory they affect.

The Org Node learns from its own actions, feedback, and artifacts.
