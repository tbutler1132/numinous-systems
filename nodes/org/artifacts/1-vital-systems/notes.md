# Vital Systems — Notes

- Vital Systems frames life, creative work, and organizations as living systems operating inside mechanized environments.
- The core tension is not humans vs machines, but vitality inside abstraction and automation.
- The orientation is toward viability, not optimization, scale, or winning.
- Cybernetics is used as a discipline of feedback and regulation, not as machinery or automation.
- Action → feedback → memory → adjustment is treated as lived practice, not a diagram.
- Beauty, form, and clarity are treated as signals of internal alignment, not branding or decoration.
- The essay is meant to orient, not persuade or instruct.
- It avoids moralizing, villains, or calls to action.
- It treats restraint and slowness as prerequisites for learning.
- Artifacts are privileged over explanation; what matters should leave a trace.
- Structure should only be encoded when reality forces it; code is treated as binding commitment.
- The essay is an experiment and may fail; failure is acceptable if learning occurs.
- Versions of the essay are expressions of the same intent and should be retained as memory.
- If the text stops producing clarity or resonance, it should be revised or retired.
