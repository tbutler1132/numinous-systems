# Beauty as the Highest Ideal

## Artifact Concept

This folder contains a developing text on **beauty as the ultimate orientation**.

The central claim is that seeking beauty—not utility, not optimization, not survival—is the highest ideal. Beauty is the moment where time freezes. It is what "solves" entropy.

This is not aesthetics in the narrow sense. Beauty here includes:

- pure grandiosity (cathedrals, monuments, sublime landscapes)
- love for family, presence with people
- moments of stillness where everything coheres

## What This Is Not

This is not a theory of art or taste.
It is not a framework for evaluating beauty.
It is not about making things pretty.

It is an attempt to articulate why beauty—wherever it appears—feels like the point.

## Status

This artifact is in early formation.

An essay will follow. For now, the folder holds notes and orienting fragments.
