# Beauty as the Highest Ideal — Notes

- Beauty as the highest or ultimate ideal, not a secondary concern
- Can manifest as pure grandiosity: cathedrals, monuments, vast architecture
- Can also manifest as love for family, presence, intimacy
- These are not different categories—they share something essential
- Beauty is the moment where time freezes
- This is what "solves" entropy
- Entropy is the arrow of time, decay, dissolution
- Beauty is the counter-force: coherence, meaning, stillness
- Not preservation (that's just slower decay)
- Something more like transcendence or stepping outside time
- The experience of beauty suspends the ordinary flow
- This may be why we build things meant to outlast us
- And why we cherish moments that cannot be preserved
- Both point toward the same thing
