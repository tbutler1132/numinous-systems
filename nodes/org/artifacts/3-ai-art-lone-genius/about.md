# AI Art and the Myth of the Lone Genius

## Artifact Concept

This folder contains a developing essay responding to the widespread discomfort with AI-generated art.

The hypothesis: the reaction reveals more about modern assumptions than about AI itself.

The core argument:

1. The "lone artistic genius" is a modern construct, not a timeless truth
2. Historically, art was viewed as craft and skill; beauty was understood as divine in origin
3. Rationalism and secularization required relocating the source of beauty—it moved from God to the individual genius
4. But the genius myth doesn't hold up: everyone iterates on existing ideas, builds from tradition, borrows forms
5. The "lone genius" is more marketing narrative than description of how creation actually works
6. AI art disrupts the marketing, not the reality
7. Moving past individualistic framing reopens access to raw sublime beauty
8. This may actually enable more communal modes of organization and action
