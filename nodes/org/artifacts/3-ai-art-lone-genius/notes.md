# AI Art and the Myth of the Lone Genius — Notes

## The reaction to AI art
- People are deeply offput by AI-generated art
- The intensity of the reaction suggests something deeper is being threatened
- Not just economic concerns (though those exist)
- Something about identity, meaning, authorship

## The lone genius is a modern construct
- Need to verify: how was art/artistry understood before modernity?
- Hypothesis: art was a skill, a craft, a trade
- Beauty was understood as divine in origin—artists were channels, not sources
- The Romantic era and rationalism shifted this
- When you can't locate beauty in God, you locate it in the individual
- The genius becomes the secular replacement for the divine

## The genius myth doesn't hold
- Everyone iterates on existing ideas
- All artists build from tradition, borrow forms, remix influences
- "Originality" is mostly recombination with personal inflection
- The lone genius is a marketing construct more than a description of reality
- It serves commercial and status functions

## What AI art actually disrupts
- AI doesn't disrupt creation—it disrupts the marketing narrative
- The product (beauty, form, coherence) can emerge without the genius story
- This is threatening because the story was load-bearing for meaning

## The opportunity
- If we move past the individualistic framing
- We can look again at raw sublime beauty without needing to attribute it to a special person
- This might open paths toward more communal organization and action
- Art as collective practice, not individual achievement
- Resonates with pre-modern and non-Western traditions

## Genius vs experiencer
- The genius myth is about CREATION—special creative capacity, unique authorship
- But the project still depends on a subject who EXPERIENCES beauty
- Is this a contradiction? No—different claims:
  - Genius (myth): some people have special creative power that originates beauty
  - Experiencer (real): all humans have perceptual capacity for beauty
- The genius is demystified because creation is always collective, iterative, capital-orchestrated
- The experiencer is not demystified because perception is universal—everyone can have the moment where time stops
- Clearing the genius myth doesn't flatten experience; it opens access
- Beauty is not made by special people; it is perceived by everyone

## Questions to explore
- What did pre-Romantic cultures actually believe about artistic creation?
- How do craft traditions handle authorship and originality?
- What are the actual psychological/social functions of the genius myth?
- Does AI art feel different when you're not trying to attribute it to anyone?
