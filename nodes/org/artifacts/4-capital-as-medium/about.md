# Capital as Medium

## Artifact Concept

This folder contains a developing essay on **capital orchestration as a creative medium**.

The essay addresses what creative work actually looks like at industrial scale—and what that means for how we think about authorship, AI, and the future of making things.

## What This Artifact Addresses

- How large-scale creative work is fundamentally capital orchestration (marshaling money, labor, technology, logistics)
- Why the "genius" designation is a system position, not an intrinsic quality
- The incoherence of opposing AI while embedded in industrial creative systems
- What coherent action looks like: orchestrating capital toward beauty, or actually living as an outsider
- How clarity about the system enables coherent action

## Connection to Broader Project

If beauty is the highest ideal (artifact 2), and large-scale creative work is fundamentally capital orchestration, then the question becomes: **how do you direct capital toward beauty rather than extraction?**

Seeing the system clearly is the prerequisite for directing it well.

## Status

This artifact is in development. The argument structure is refined; the essay is not yet written.
