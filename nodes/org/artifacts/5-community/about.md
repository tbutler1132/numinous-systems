# Community

## Artifact Concept

This folder contains a developing essay on **community as biological expectation**.

The claim is simple: humans are wired for a certain kind of community—stable bonds, mutual dependence, shared context over time. This isn't sentimentality. It's architecture. We developed in small groups with dense, long-term relationships. That's what the hardware expects.

Modern life systematically fails to provide this. The same forces that fragment attention, elevate individuals over collectives, and optimize for extraction also prevent deep bonds from forming. Loneliness isn't a bug—it's a predictable output of the system.

## Core Claims

1. Community is a biological expectation, not a preference or luxury
2. Modern structures actively work against it—fragmentation, mobility, individualism, mediated relationships
3. This produces widespread suffering that gets medicalized or moralized rather than understood structurally
4. The project of forming real communities is not nostalgia—it's alignment with what humans actually need to function
5. This connects to beauty: genuine community may be one of the forms beauty takes at the social level

## Connection to Broader Project

If beauty is the highest ideal, community is part of what that means for social life.

If capital orchestration is the medium at scale, the question becomes: can capital be directed toward community formation rather than fragmentation?

The forces that create the genius myth and obscure industrial reality also atomize people. Clarity about the system is a prerequisite for building alternatives.
