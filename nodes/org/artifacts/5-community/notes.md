# Community — Notes

## The basic claim
- Humans are wired for a certain kind of community
- Stable bonds, mutual dependence, shared context over time
- Small groups, dense relationships, long-term continuity
- This is what the hardware expects—we evolved in these conditions

## Not sentimentality
- This isn't "community is nice" or "we should be nicer to each other"
- It's architectural—the system requires certain inputs to function
- Like nutrition or sleep, community is a biological requirement
- Deprivation produces predictable dysfunction

## What modern life fails to provide
- Stable long-term relationships (mobility, job changes, transience)
- Mutual dependence (independence as ideal, self-sufficiency as virtue)
- Shared context (fragmented attention, algorithmic feeds, niche identities)
- Density of interaction (remote work, suburban isolation, screen mediation)
- Intergenerational connection (age segregation, nuclear family as unit)

## Forces that fragment
- Economic mobility requirements (follow the job)
- Individualism as ideology (self-actualization, personal brand)
- Mediated relationships (social media as substitute for presence)
- Optimization of attention (engagement metrics, outrage loops)
- Capital extraction (community as market, relationships as transactions)

## The suffering this produces
- Loneliness epidemic (well-documented, accelerating)
- Mental health crisis (anxiety, depression, meaninglessness)
- Gets medicalized (individual pathology) rather than understood structurally
- Gets moralized ("build community!" as self-help) rather than addressed systemically
- The environment produces the outcome; individuals can't opt out alone

## Not nostalgia
- The project isn't "return to village life"
- It's alignment with biological expectations in current conditions
- What would community look like given technology, mobility, scale?
- Not rejection of modernity but navigation of it

## Connection to beauty
- Community may be one form beauty takes at the social level
- The experience of belonging, mutual recognition, shared endeavor
- This is "time freezing" in social form—moments of connection that feel outside entropy
- Beauty isn't just visual/aesthetic—it includes relational coherence

## Connection to capital-as-medium
- Can capital be directed toward community formation rather than fragmentation?
- What would that look like?
- The same forces that create the genius myth also atomize people
- Clarity about the system is prerequisite for building alternatives

## Open questions
- What are examples of community that work under modern conditions?
- What's the minimum viable structure for stable community?
- How does technology help vs. harm? (Not simple—some platforms do enable connection)
- What does community formation look like as a practice, not just an ideal?
