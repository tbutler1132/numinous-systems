# The Hybrid Subject

## Artifact Concept

This folder contains a developing essay on **what "human" actually means under current conditions**.

The core claim: modern humans are not pure biological beings who happen to use technology. We are hybrid entities—**part biological, part synthetic**. The synthetic layer (capital, technology, algorithms, designed environments) is constitutive of our subjectivity, not merely external tools we employ.

This isn't critique—it's description. And it has practical implications for anyone trying to design alternatives.

## What This Artifact Addresses

- What "biological" and "synthetic" mean as categories
- Why the synthetic layer is constitutive (part of what we are) rather than instrumental (tools we use)
- The range problem: humanness has a floor (biological requirements) and a ceiling (beyond which you've exceeded humanness)
- Why both nostalgia (return to pure biology) and accelerationism (transcend biology) are mistakes
- The task: navigate within the viable range

## Connection to Broader Project

This essay provides the anthropological foundation for the other artifacts.

- **Beauty**: Beauty is what the human experiences. Exceed humanness, and there's no subject left to experience it.
- **Capital-as-Medium**: We're already part-synthetic. Working with capital isn't corruption—it's working with part of what we are.
- **Community**: Community is a biological requirement—part of the floor that can't be optimized away.
- **Vital Systems**: The hybrid human IS a living system operating inside a mechanized environment.
- **Aesthetic Spectrum**: "Emotional distortion" is the sound of biological feeling filtered through synthetic mediation.

## Status

This artifact is early. The argument is sketched; the essay is not yet written.
