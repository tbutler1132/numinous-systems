# Axioms

## Artifact Concept

This folder contains the **foundational axioms** underlying the project.

These are not conclusions reached through argument. They are starting points—claims about what matters and why, stated without justification. The other essays proceed from these, whether explicitly or not.

The register is devotional rather than analytical. These are affirmations, not propositions to be defended.

## The Axioms

1. **Life is sacred because it exists.**
2. **Beauty is the highest expression of order and vitality.**
3. **Creation is devotion.**
4. **To live beautifully is to affirm being.**
5. **To perceive deeply is to participate in the divine.**

## What These Are Not

These are not:
- Conclusions of argument (they are premises)
- Religious doctrine (they invoke the sacred without requiring theology)
- Moral commands (they describe orientation, not obligation)
- Complete (they may be added to or revised)

## Connection to Broader Project

Every artifact in this project implicitly depends on something like these axioms.

- **Vital Systems**: Life as the fundamental value; viability over optimization
- **Beauty as the highest ideal**: Beauty as what we're oriented toward
- **The genius myth / Capital-as-medium**: Creation as practice, not performance
- **Community**: Sacred life includes sacred relation
- **The hybrid subject**: What makes humanness worth preserving is its capacity for beauty, perception, creation

The axioms make explicit what the essays assume.

## Status

These axioms are active. They may be refined as understanding deepens.
