# Artifacts

This directory contains **artifacts** produced by the Org.

An artifact is a durable output that remains after effort stops and can be referenced without requiring access to the process, context, or person that produced it.

Artifacts are not notes, drafts, or internal deliberation.
They are the primary way this Org leaves traces in the world.

## Purpose

Artifacts serve three functions:

- They make thinking legible without explanation
- They allow feedback from reality and other people
- They preserve memory across time and change

If something matters, it should eventually become an artifact.

## Structure

Some artifacts may be simple, single files.
Others may have internal structure.

When an artifact represents a creative or conceptual work that evolves over time, it may be organized as a folder containing:

- a README describing the intent of the artifact
- one or more concrete expressions or versions

This structure is optional and used only when it adds clarity.

## What Artifacts Are Not

Artifacts are not:

- commitments or promises
- doctrine or rules
- exhaustive representations of process
- optimized for engagement or scale

They may be incomplete, provisional, or limited in scope.

## Change and Retention

Artifacts may be revised as understanding changes.
