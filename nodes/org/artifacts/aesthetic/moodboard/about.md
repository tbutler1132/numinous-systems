# Moodboard

## Artifact Concept

A curated collection of visual references that embody the aesthetic spectrum—from elegant to alien.

This is not a mood board in the marketing sense (aspirational lifestyle imagery). It's a working reference for what the aesthetic *looks like* in the wild: found examples, inspirations, and anti-examples that clarify the boundaries.

## What This Artifact Addresses

- Visual vocabulary for the elegant ↔ alien spectrum
- Concrete examples of "emotional distortion" in visual form
- Reference material for design decisions across all artifacts
- Anti-examples that clarify what the aesthetic is *not*

## Connection to Broader Project

This moodboard is the visual companion to the Aesthetic Spectrum artifact. Where that artifact *describes* the aesthetic in words, this one *shows* it.

Both serve the same purpose: making the sensory vocabulary legible and shareable.

## Status

Living collection. Grows as references are discovered.
