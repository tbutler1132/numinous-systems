# Albums

## Artifact Concept

This folder contains **albums** — curated sequences of songs organized around a unifying narrative or thematic structure.

An album is not just a collection. It is a **journey** — a deliberate arrangement where the sequence creates meaning that individual songs cannot achieve alone.

## Philosophy

Albums in this system follow an emergent approach:

1. **Songs come first** — each song is created as its own artifact, following its own logic
2. **Patterns reveal themselves** — over time, thematic clusters and narrative arcs become visible
3. **Retroactive mapping** — songs are assigned to positions in a structure (like the Hero's Journey) based on fit, not forced into predetermined slots

This honors both the creative process (letting songs be what they need to be) and the structural vision (finding the larger pattern they collectively form).

## Connection to Broader Project

- **Beauty Redeems**: An album is a sustained aesthetic experience — a redemptive arc extended across time
- **Songs**: Albums give individual songs context within a larger whole
- **Aesthetic**: Albums embody and express the project's aesthetic vocabulary at scale

## Current Albums

- **Album 1** (working title) — A concept album mapping to Vogler's Hero's Journey
