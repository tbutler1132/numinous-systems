# Refusal of the Call

## Stage 3 of the Hero's Journey

The hero **hesitates**. The call is too frightening, the cost too high, the risk too great. They attempt to return to normal, to pretend the call never came.

This refusal is not weakness — it's human. It acknowledges the genuine danger of transformation. The old self knows it will not survive the journey.

## Musical Character

Songs that fit this stage might embody:
- **Fear** — the terror of what lies ahead
- **Denial** — pretending nothing has changed
- **Bargaining** — seeking another way
- **Paralysis** — unable to move forward or back

## Candidate Songs

*To be determined through listening and mapping.*
