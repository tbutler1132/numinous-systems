# Tests, Allies, Enemies

## Stage 6 of the Hero's Journey

The hero navigates the **special world**. They face challenges that test their resolve, meet allies who will aid them, and encounter enemies who oppose their quest.

This is the learning phase. The hero discovers what works and what doesn't, who can be trusted and who cannot. Skills are developed. Bonds are formed.
