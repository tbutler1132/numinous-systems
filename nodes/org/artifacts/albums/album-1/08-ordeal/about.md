# Ordeal

## Stage 8 of the Hero's Journey

The hero faces **death** — literal or metaphorical. This is the supreme crisis, the moment everything hangs in the balance. The old self must die for the new self to be born.

The Ordeal is the heart of the story. It is the transformation itself, the crucible where the hero is unmade and remade.

## Musical Character

Songs that fit this stage might embody:
- **Crisis** — everything falling apart
- **Confrontation** — facing the ultimate fear
- **Death** — the end of what was
- **Surrender** — letting go of control

## Candidate Songs

*To be determined through listening and mapping.*

## Notes
