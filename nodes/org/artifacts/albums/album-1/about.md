# Album 1

## Artifact Concept

This is a **concept album** structured around Christopher Vogler's 12-stage Hero's Journey.

The album tells a complete story — from the Ordinary World through transformation and back — using songs that weren't written *for* these stages but *discovered* to embody them.

## The Approach

1. **Create freely** — songs emerge from their own impulse, not narrative prescription
2. **Listen for resonance** — which stage does this song feel like?
3. **Map retroactively** — assign songs to stages based on emotional and thematic fit
4. **Allow multiplicity** — a song might fit multiple stages; stages might have multiple candidates

This is curation, not construction. The journey reveals itself through the music that already exists.

## The 12 Stages (Vogler)

| # | Stage | Description |
|---|-------|-------------|
| 1 | Ordinary World | The hero's normal life before the adventure |
| 2 | Call to Adventure | A challenge or quest is presented |
| 3 | Refusal of the Call | Initial reluctance or fear |
| 4 | Meeting the Mentor | Guidance, training, or gifts received |
| 5 | Crossing the Threshold | Leaving the familiar, entering the unknown |
| 6 | Tests, Allies, Enemies | Challenges faced, relationships formed |
| 7 | Approach to the Inmost Cave | Preparing for the central ordeal |
| 8 | Ordeal | The crisis, death and rebirth moment |
| 9 | Reward | Seizing what was sought |
| 10 | The Road Back | Beginning the return journey |
| 11 | Resurrection | Final test, transformation complete |
| 12 | Return with the Elixir | Bringing the gift back to the world |

## Connection to Broader Project

- **Beauty Redeems**: The Hero's Journey is itself about redemption — transformation through ordeal
- **Love of Fate**: The hero must accept what happens as necessary for becoming
- **The Living System**: The journey is about maintaining viability through change

## Status

In early development. Stage folders exist; song mapping has not yet begun.
