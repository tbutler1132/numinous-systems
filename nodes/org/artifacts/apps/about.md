# Apps

## Category Concept

This folder contains **user-facing applications** — software that enables engagement with the philosophy without requiring someone to read the essays.

Apps are interfaces. They translate the worldview into interaction, making it accessible through experience rather than exposition.

## What This Category Addresses

- How can someone engage with these ideas without reading philosophy?
- What interactions embody the principles?
- How does software become a medium for meaning?
- What does it look like to build tools that serve beauty rather than engagement metrics?

## Design Principles

Apps here share certain commitments:

- **Personalization without dilution** — meet people where they are without compromising what matters
- **Organic touchpoints** — natural moments of contact rather than manufactured engagement
- **Beauty as goal** — the experience should itself be beautiful, not just functional
- **Restraint** — do less, better

## Current Apps

| App             | Function                                                   |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Expressions** | Personalized engagement with artifacts via organic prompts |

## Connection to Other Categories

- **Core** provides the ideas apps embody
- **Aesthetic** provides the visual and interaction language
- **Sensors** may feed data that apps surface

## Implementation

Apps have concept folders here but implementations in `apps/` at the project root. The artifact describes what and why; the code lives where code belongs.

## Status

Expressions is live. Future apps will follow the same pattern of concept here, implementation elsewhere.
