# Apps

## Category Concept

This folder contains **user-facing applications** — software that enables engagement with the philosophy without requiring someone to read the essays.

Apps are interfaces. They translate the worldview into interaction, making it accessible through experience rather than exposition.

## What This Category Addresses

- How can someone engage with these ideas without reading philosophy?
- What interactions embody the principles?
- How does software become a medium for meaning?
- What does it look like to build tools that serve beauty rather than engagement metrics?

## Design Principles

Apps here share certain commitments:

- **Personalization without dilution** — meet people where they are without compromising what matters
- **Organic touchpoints** — natural moments of contact rather than manufactured engagement
- **Beauty as goal** — the experience should itself be beautiful, not just functional
- **Restraint** — do less, better

## Current Apps

| App             | Function                                                   |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Landing**     | Personal brand hub and entry point                         |
| **Expressions** | Personalized engagement with artifacts via organic prompts |
| **Projection**  | Navigable interface for exploring the system's canon       |

## Connection to Other Categories

- **Core** provides the ideas apps embody
- **Aesthetic** provides the visual and interaction language
- **Sensors** may feed data that apps surface

## Implementation

Org-specific apps live entirely within their artifact folders — concept (`about.md`, `notes.md`) and implementation (`impl/`) together. System-level apps that serve the entire repository belong in `apps/` at project root.

## Status

Landing and Expressions are live. Projection is in concept phase.
