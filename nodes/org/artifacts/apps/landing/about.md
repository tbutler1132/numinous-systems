# Landing

## Artifact Concept

This folder contains **Landing** — the personal brand hub and entry point.

The landing page serves as the central navigation point for all public-facing work. It presents the identity (currently Timothy Butler as stand-in for org brand) and provides pathways to other artifacts.

## What This Artifact IS

- The front door to the public presence
- A minimal, elegant hub linking to projects
- The canonical location for personal/org brand identity

## What This Artifact Is NOT

- A portfolio with extensive content
- A blog or content platform
- An app with complex functionality

## Design Principles

- **Restraint** — show only what matters
- **Beauty** — the first impression should resonate
- **Navigation** — clear pathways to actual work

## Implementation

Landing is now a route within the Projection app. The implementation lives at `apps/projection/src/app/page.tsx` and reads content from `page.md` in this folder.

## Status

This artifact is active. The landing page is the root of the projection app.
