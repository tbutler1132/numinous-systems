# Projection

## Artifact Concept

This folder contains **Projection** — a navigable interface for exploring the system's canon.

The app renders the repository as a readable, beautiful whole. It covers everything — artifacts, ontology, infrastructure, philosophy — but presents it through the org's interpretation, curation, and aesthetic.

## What This Artifact IS

- The org's documentary about the system
- A readable projection of the canon optimized for understanding
- An authored view: the subject is vast, the authorship is bounded
- A single coherent interface to content that spans nodes and infrastructure

## What This Artifact Is NOT

- The canon itself (the repo is canon; this is a view)
- A generic platform (this is the org's take, not neutral tooling)
- System-level infrastructure (this belongs to the org, even when covering system-level content)

## The Authorship Distinction

The app covers system-level content (ontology, core primitives, infrastructure) but it is still an **org artifact** because:

- The org is doing the interpreting
- The org's aesthetic shapes the presentation
- The org's curation decides what is emphasized
- The org authors this view

A film about the universe is still a human artifact. The subject is vast; the authorship is bounded.

## Connection to Broader Project

This app embodies the principles articulated in **Canon, Projections, and Becoming**:

- The repo is the authoritative map of the system
- Projections are views of the canon optimized for different purposes
- Readable projections explain; operational projections execute
- This app is a readable projection — it explains the system to those who encounter it

## Design Principles

- **Canon as source** — the app reads from the repo, never duplicates
- **Authored perspective** — this is the org's interpretation, not raw file rendering
- **Beauty as goal** — the experience should itself be beautiful
- **Restraint** — show what matters, hide what doesn't

## Status

This artifact is in **concept phase**. The idea is locked in; implementation has not begun.
