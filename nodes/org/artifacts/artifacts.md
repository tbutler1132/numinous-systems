# Artifacts

This directory contains **artifacts** produced by the Org.

An artifact is a durable output that remains after effort stops and can be referenced without requiring access to the process, context, or person that produced it.

Artifacts are not notes, drafts, or internal deliberation.
They are the primary way this Org leaves traces in the world.

## Purpose

Artifacts serve three functions:

- They make thinking legible without explanation
- They allow feedback from reality and other people
- They preserve memory across time and change

If something matters, it should eventually become an artifact.

## Structure

Each artifact is a folder containing:

- **about.md** — The conceptual container. Describes what this artifact IS: its purpose, what questions it addresses, how it connects to the broader project, and its current status. This file is stable and abstract. It should not contain specific arguments, examples, or worked-out content.

- **notes.md** — Working material. Contains specific ideas, examples, arguments, drafts, and open questions. This is where the actual content develops. Notes can change freely as thinking evolves.

- **Expressions** (optional) — Specific versions or outputs of the artifact. An essay, a recording, a visual piece. These are concrete manifestations of the concept described in about.md.

This structure separates the _concept_ (about.md) from the _content_ (notes.md) from the _output_ (expressions). The concept can remain stable while the content evolves and expressions multiply.

## What Artifacts Are Not

Artifacts are not:

- commitments or promises
- doctrine or rules
- exhaustive representations of process
- optimized for engagement or scale

They may be incomplete, provisional, or limited in scope.

## Change and Retention

Artifacts may be revised as understanding changes.
Earlier versions are retained as part of the artifact's memory.

**Everything serves one purpose: enabling moments that redeem existence.**

The axioms ground affirmation. Love of fate clears regret so presence is possible. What We Are defines what must be preserved for there to be someone who experiences beauty—the hybrid subject, the biological requirements, the viable range. Capital as Medium enables creation at scale. The Genius Myth clears false framing. The Aesthetic Spectrum is how redemption sounds and looks. Songs are concrete expressions. Tools enable individuals to engage in their own way.
