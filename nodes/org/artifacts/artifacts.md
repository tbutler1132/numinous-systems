# Artifacts

This directory contains **artifacts** produced by the Org.

An artifact is a durable output that remains after effort stops and can be referenced without requiring access to the process, context, or person that produced it.

Artifacts are not notes, drafts, or internal deliberation.
They are the primary way this Org leaves traces in the world.

## Purpose

Artifacts serve three functions:

- They make thinking legible without explanation
- They allow feedback from reality and other people
- They preserve memory across time and change

If something matters, it should eventually become an artifact.

## Structure

Some artifacts may be simple, single files.
Others may have internal structure.

When an artifact represents a creative or conceptual work that evolves over time, it may be organized as a folder containing:

- a README describing the intent of the artifact
- one or more concrete expressions or versions

This structure is optional and used only when it adds clarity.

## What Artifacts Are Not

Artifacts are not:

- commitments or promises
- doctrine or rules
- exhaustive representations of process
- optimized for engagement or scale

They may be incomplete, provisional, or limited in scope.

## Change and Retention

Artifacts may be revised as understanding changes.
Earlier versions are retained as part of the artifact's memory.

| 7   | **Axioms**         | Philosophical starting points—what is affirmed without argument               |
| 6   | **Hybrid Subject** | What "human" means under current conditions (part-biological, part-synthetic) |
| 1   | **Vital Systems**  | Meta-framework: living systems inside mechanized environments                 |

### Conceptual Layer

| #   | Artifact                 | Purpose                                                                          |

| 2   | **Beauty as Ideal**      | The orienting value—beauty as highest expression, time freezing, solving entropy |
| 5   | **Community**            | Biological requirement—what humans need to function                              |
| 4   | **Capital-as-Medium**    | What large-scale creative work actually is—orchestrating capital toward beauty   |
| 3   | **AI Art / Lone Genius** | Clearing a false framing—the genius myth and why it's breaking down              |

### Expressive Layer

| #   | Artifact               | Purpose                                                             |

| 8   | **Aesthetic Spectrum** | Sensory expression—how the philosophy becomes music and visual form |

### How They Connect

```
Axioms (what we affirm)
    ↓
Hybrid Subject (what we are) ← → Vital Systems (how living systems work)
    ↓
Beauty (what we orient toward) ← → Community (what we need)
    ↓
Capital-as-Medium (how we create at scale) ← clears → Genius Myth (false framing)
    ↓
Aesthetic Spectrum (how it sounds and looks)
```

The axioms ground everything. The hybrid subject and vital systems describe the condition. Beauty and community describe what matters. Capital-as-medium describes the practice. The aesthetic spectrum is the sensory output.
