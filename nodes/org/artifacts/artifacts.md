# Artifacts

This directory contains [artifacts](../../ontology.md#artifact) produced by the Org.

An artifact is a durable output that remains after effort stops and can be referenced without requiring access to the process, context, or person that produced it.

Artifacts are not notes, drafts, or internal deliberation.
They are the primary way this Org leaves traces in the world—what remains when the process that made them is gone.

## Purpose

Artifacts serve three functions:

- They make thinking legible without explanation
- They allow feedback from reality and other people
- They preserve memory across time and change

If something matters, it should eventually become an artifact.

## Structure

Each artifact is a folder containing:

- **about.md** — The conceptual container. Describes what this artifact IS: its purpose, what questions it addresses, how it connects to the broader project, and its current status. This file is stable and abstract. It should not contain specific arguments, examples, or worked-out content.

- **notes.md** — Working material. Contains specific ideas, examples, arguments, drafts, and open questions. This is where the actual content develops. Notes can change freely as thinking evolves.

- **Expressions** (optional) — Specific versions or outputs of the artifact. An essay, a recording, a visual piece. These are concrete manifestations of the concept described in about.md.

This structure separates the _concept_ (about.md) from the _content_ (notes.md) from the _output_ (expressions). The concept can remain stable while the content evolves and expressions multiply.

Some artifacts (particularly apps) include implementations alongside their concept. For example, the Expressions app artifact contains an `impl/` folder with its code. The artifact folder holds both the concept (about.md, notes.md) and the implementation.

## What Artifacts Are Not

Artifacts are not:

- commitments or promises
- doctrine or rules
- exhaustive representations of process
- optimized for engagement or scale

They may be incomplete, provisional, or limited in scope.

## Change and Retention

Artifacts may be revised as understanding changes.
Earlier versions are retained as part of the artifact's memory.

**Everything serves one purpose: enabling moments that redeem existence.**

The Living System defines what must be preserved for there to be someone who experiences beauty—the hybrid subject, the biological requirements, the viable range. Love of fate clears regret so presence is possible. Capital as Medium enables creation at scale. The Axioms distill it all into ground-level affirmations. The Genius Myth clears false framing. The Aesthetic Spectrum is how redemption sounds and looks. Songs are concrete expressions. Apps enable personalized engagement. Sensors observe and remember. XenoScript enables semantic programming.

The Becoming Engine Doctrine sits outside the main tree as a **reference** — a mature system to check against when asking "are we drifting into optimization?" or "are we creating permanent mobilization?" It provides invariants and guardrails, not requirements.
