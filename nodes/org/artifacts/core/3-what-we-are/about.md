# What We Are

## Artifact Concept

This folder contains the anthropological foundation of the project: **what "human" actually means under current conditions, and what's required to preserve it**.

The core claim: modern humans are not pure biological beings who happen to use technology. We are hybrid entities—part biological, part synthetic. The synthetic layer (capital, technology, algorithms, designed environments) is constitutive of our subjectivity, not merely external tools we employ.

This isn't critique—it's description. And it has practical implications for anyone trying to design alternatives.

## What This Artifact Addresses

### The Hybrid Condition
- What "biological" and "synthetic" mean as categories
- Why the synthetic layer is constitutive (part of what we are) rather than instrumental (tools we use)
- No pure baseline exists—the hybrid is what we have

### The Viable Range
- Humanness has boundaries: a **floor** and a **ceiling**
- **The floor** = biological requirements that can't be optimized away: community, embodiment, meaning, attention limits
- **The ceiling** = the point where optimization kills the thing being optimized—exceed humanness and there's no subject left to experience beauty
- The task: navigate within this range

### Community as Biological Architecture
- Humans are wired for stable bonds, mutual dependence, shared context over time
- This isn't sentimentality—it's what the hardware expects
- Modern life systematically fails to provide this
- Loneliness is a predictable output of the system, not individual failure

### Viability Over Optimization
- Living systems operating inside mechanized environments
- Feedback over narrative; restraint over scale
- Form and beauty as signals of internal coherence
- The viable system maintains itself; the optimized system exceeds itself

## Connection to Broader Project

This essay provides the anthropological foundation for everything else.

- **Beauty Redeems**: Beauty is what the human experiences. Exceed humanness, and there's no subject left to experience it.
- **Axioms**: What makes humanness worth preserving is its capacity for beauty, perception, creation.
- **Love of Fate**: The viable range requires acceptance of the hybrid condition. You navigate what is.
- **Capital as Medium**: We're already part-synthetic. Working with capital isn't corruption—it's working with part of what we are.

## Status

This artifact is in development. The argument structure is refined; the unified essay is not yet written.
