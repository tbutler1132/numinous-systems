  # Axioms
  
  ## Artifact Concept
  
  This folder contains the **foundational axioms** underlying the project.
  
  These are not conclusions reached through argument. They are starting points—claims about what matters and why, stated without justification. The other essays proceed from these, whether explicitly or not.
  
  The register is devotional rather than analytical. These are affirmations, not propositions to be defended.
  
  ## The Axioms
  
  1. **Life is sacred because it exists.**
  2. **Beauty is the highest expression of order and vitality.**
  3. **Creation is devotion.**
  4. **To live beautifully is to affirm being.**
  5. **To perceive deeply is to participate in the divine.**
  
  ## What These Are Not
  
  These are not:
  - Conclusions of argument (they are premises)
  - Religious doctrine (they invoke the sacred without requiring theology)
  - Moral commands (they describe orientation, not obligation)
  - Complete (they may be added to or revised)
  
  ## On Agency
  
  This project speaks as if we act—as if we choose, orient, create, direct. That is how action feels from inside.
  
  Whether we are "free" in some metaphysical sense is a separate question, and perhaps the wrong one. The forces that move us—time, causation, everything that led to this moment—are vast and largely beyond awareness, let alone control. We do not stand outside the unfolding and choose our path. We are the unfolding.
  
  And yet: striving happens. Orientation happens. The experience of deliberation is real, even if determined. When the project says "orchestrate capital toward beauty" or "navigate the viable range," it is not claiming libertarian free will. It is describing what these processes look like from within.
  
  To affirm being is not to claim you chose it freely. It is to say yes to what is happening—including your own participation in it. Amor fati applies here too: even your agency, such as it is, is part of fate.
  
  ## Connection to Broader Project
  
  Every artifact in this project implicitly depends on something like these axioms.
  
  - **Beauty Redeems**: Beauty as what we're oriented toward
  - **The Living System**: What makes humanness worth preserving is its capacity for beauty, perception, creation
  - **Love of Fate**: "To live beautifully is to affirm being"—applied to loss
  - **Capital as Medium**: Creation as practice in devotion, not performance
  
  The axioms make explicit what the essays assume.
  
  ## Status
  
  These axioms are active. They may be refined as understanding deepens.
