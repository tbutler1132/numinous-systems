# Capital as Medium

## I. The Core Reframe

Everything people fear about AI has been running for decades.

Hollywood IS the AI process: iteration on existing IP, recombination of proven formulas, optimization via test screenings, distributed authorship, data-driven decisions.

The human "genius" is a branding layer on top of an algorithmic process. Fighting AI as if it's coming is wasted energy when you're already inside the process.

## II. Historical Grounding

This isn't new or sudden:

| Era | Development |
|-----|-------------|
| **1930s-40s** | The studio system was already a factory |
| **1970s-80s** | The blockbuster era (Jaws, Star Wars) intensified it |
| **1990s-2000s** | Franchise logic and IP exploitation accelerated further |
| **Now** | AI is the current phase, not a rupture |

## III. The System Creates the Genius

Capital/Hollywood anoints people as special, tells them they're unique. This gives them status and power to work with capital.

In return, they become the face that legitimizes the operation.

**Mutual dependency**: Capital needs named geniuses for marketing. The anointed get access in return.

The genius designation is a **system position**, not an intrinsic quality.

---

## IV. What About Genuine Human Creativity?

Human judgment, taste, and vision exist.

But at industrial scale, these are *inputs* to capital orchestration, not the thing itself. The director has taste. So does the algorithm.

The question is what the *system* produces.

## V. What Coherence Looks Like

### Option A: Orchestrate Capital Toward Beauty Honestly

Just make beautiful things. Put beauty into the world. That's enough.

You don't have to be a revolutionary. The bar: produce beauty, don't pretend you're doing something you're not.

The hypocrisy isn't in working within the system—it's in moralizing as if you're above it.

### Option B: Actually Live by Outsider Principles

Real risk. Experimental work. Probably walking away from the deals. Actually being an outsider.

Accepting the material consequences.

### What Incoherence Looks Like

Holding the cushy system position AND moralizing as if you're outside it. Invoking "true art" principles while embedded in industrial creative systems.

## VI. A Note on These "Options"

These aren't options you stand outside and choose between. They're descriptions of how people find themselves acting.

The question isn't "which should you pick?" but "which are you actually doing?"

---

## VII. The Hopeful Note

If AI makes the process visible, that's actually good.

Dropping the genius myth opens space for honesty. Seeing clearly enables acting well.

This might enable:
- More communal, collective forms of creation
- Directing capital toward beauty instead of extraction

The alternative—delusion, fighting reality—just produces pain.

---

## VIII. The Central Question

If beauty is the highest ideal, and large-scale creative work is fundamentally capital orchestration, then:

**How do you orchestrate capital toward beauty rather than extraction?**

This is the central question.

---

## IX. The Sacred Thread

Industrial production desacralizes creation. The genius myth is a secular substitute for the sacred.

Dropping it might reopen access to something older: art as craft, as devotion, as collective practice.

"True art is beauty, community, maybe even religion."

---

## X. The Takeaway

1. Understand the system for what it is
2. Model reality well to direct it well
3. At least try to direct capital toward beauty
