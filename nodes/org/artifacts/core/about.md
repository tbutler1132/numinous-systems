# Core

## Category Concept

This folder contains the **five foundational essays** — the philosophical bedrock of the project.

Reading these five pieces, someone understands the worldview. Everything else in the artifacts tree either develops, expresses, or applies what is established here.

## What This Category Addresses

- What is the purpose of existence? (Beauty Redeems)
- What must be preserved for that purpose to matter? (The Living System)
- What posture enables presence to beauty? (Love of Fate)
- How does one act toward beauty at scale? (Capital as Medium)
- What is affirmed without argument? (Axioms)

## The Five Essays

| #   | Essay                 | Function                                            |
| --- | --------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | **Beauty Redeems**    | The telos — moments of beauty redeem existence      |
| 2   | **The Living System** | The subject — what must be preserved to experience  |
| 3   | **Love of Fate**      | The posture — clearing regret for presence          |
| 4   | **Capital as Medium** | The practice — orchestrating capital toward beauty  |
| 5   | **Axioms**            | The distillation — ground-level affirmations        |

## Reading Order

**Purpose → Subject → Posture → Practice → Distillation**

Start with why beauty matters, understand what kind of being experiences it, clear the obstacles to presence, learn to act at scale, then see the principles distilled.

## Connection to Other Categories

Every other category serves this one:

- **Essays** develop specific arguments implied here
- **Aesthetic** gives sensory form to the abstractions
- **Songs** are concrete expressions of the worldview
- **Story** narrates the lived experience of these ideas
- **Apps** enable engagement with them
- **Sensors** provide the memory to act on them
- **Reference** offers guardrails to check against

## Status

All five essays exist in conceptual form. Expression and refinement are ongoing.
