# Essays

## Category Concept

This folder contains **supporting arguments** — essays that develop specific themes implied by but not fully explored in the core philosophy.

These are not the foundation. They are the scaffolding that reinforces it, the explorations that test its implications, the clearings that remove obstacles to understanding.

## What This Category Addresses

- What false framings need to be cleared? (The Genius Myth, The Weakness of Cringe)
- What practical problems does the philosophy illuminate? (Continuity of Intention)
- What does building with these ideas teach?

## Relationship to Core

Core essays establish the worldview. Essays here:

- **Extend** — develop implications the core essays don't have space for
- **Clear** — remove false framings that block understanding
- **Apply** — show the philosophy engaging with specific problems
- **Reflect** — document what is learned through practice

An essay might graduate to core if it proves foundational. More often, essays remain supporting — valuable, but not load-bearing.
