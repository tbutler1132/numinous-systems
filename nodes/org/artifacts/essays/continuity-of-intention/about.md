# Continuity of Intention

## Artifact Concept

This folder contains an exploration of why todo systems and PKM tools keep being rebuilt, and what this reveals about the fundamental human problem they address.

The core claim: **Humans keep building todo and PKM systems because they are the minimum technology required to remain the same person tomorrow.**

This is not a productivity problem. It's an existential one.

## What This Artifact Addresses

- The distinction between constraint engines and todo systems—why constraints are not "negative todos" but action-space sculptors
- The generalization problem: what happens when "todo" expands to cover robots, markets, planes, and everything else
- The missing dimension: representation—what makes human todo systems special
- A better decomposition: splitting action systems along three orthogonal axes (agency, representation, constraint vs selection)
- Why everyone keeps rebuilding the same loop: capture → interpret → decide → act → reflect
- The deepest answer: humans are the only systems that must externalize intention to remain coherent

## The Core Insight

The most fundamental human activity is not "doing things"—it's **maintaining coherence over time**.

Humans are:
- temporally extended
- forgetful
- value-conflicted
- context-switching
- socially entangled

A todo list is the smallest external structure that stabilizes all of that. It's a **prosthetic for continuity of intention**.

## Connection to Broader Project

- **The Living System**: Preserving humanness includes preserving the capacity to maintain intention across time
- **Beauty Redeems**: Redemptive moments require presence, which requires coherence—you can't be present if you're fragmented
- **Capital as Medium**: The tools we build (including todo apps) are part of how we orchestrate capital toward beauty

## Status

This artifact is exploratory. The notes contain working material that develops the argument about why todo systems exist and what they reveal about human nature.
