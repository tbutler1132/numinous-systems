- Explain the thought process behind the project. My WEMI system idea is actually pretty cool (Ship of Theseus), and I am able to write notes. Was debating making time to write it, I don't love writing. I have done AI writing collaboration before (maybe can show prior manifesto but be clear I've moved on), which I am not opposed to at all. Writing notes + about and then just having AI do it I think is a little weak, but tempting
- Either way, this did lead me to the idea of why not just have the user generate a personalized one
  - Drawbacks: Of course I can't edit it at all
  - Positives: Theoretically you could get the same idea across maybe more in their voice actually
- Probably captures a good balance between just presenting AI slop, and giving some guided, particapoty, AI assistance
- Def a problem with AI in general, is you just move too fast. It's hard to slow down and read through the about and notes honestly
- I can get into theory of software in general
- Maybe touch briefly upon ideas, or just don't lol
- Mention how I went double meta though by grounding it
- Frame it in the context of just like working with AI, moving fast. It has all angles: AI coding, AI writing, etc.
- Make sure to mention though how part of the point of the project is that is doesn't need to be my Voice, that's not really the point. It's just about communicating the ideas. This can connect to the broader project
- The meta thing is that between starting with this organic essay, and the medium/presntation of the app itself, I actually do think the ideas can be more compelling despite never getting a real human, written treatment. I think the message of one organic touchpoint, and the rest of the presentation could work. It communicates a lot that otherwise might require very skilled and effort intensive writing
  - This really introduces the concept of the organic touchpoint
  - The key that holds everything together
- Try to work all other core artifact concepts into this essay
- "Taste" is an interesting concept as it relates to AI outputs. Problem is, and this may be my own bias, it tends to have an exlcusionary connotation. But through the lens of pure information compression, which also is beauty definition of beauty, it has a very real function
- Maybe my concepts are a bit overdramatic, but there is a belief that goes to the depths of my soul. For example with beauty, I get caught up in this idea of death. And I imagine the outside of time. I have no reason to actually believe it is possible to transcend that, but I truly believe through raw force and understanding, what we are, capital, beauty it is possible to make such a moment emerge. You can cringe at that, not buy it, but I believe through these things it is possible
  - Also "cringe" is such a weak emotion, link to github notes on this essay (prob won't be even close to finished)
  - One of the most haunting thoughts is the finality of death. "I know you're alive God's not finished
    - There is the immediate loss, but also long term
    - I can link 24 Remix here. Talk about flipping the vibe of the song. Maybe mention the Ye stuff (This can go in 24 notes, I will merely mention the song in this essay)
- Since I am getting into the link flow, I could briefly mention "All the Things You Love", since it is in fact an artifact. Just like this is my current best plan to produce something
  - Might be out of scope for this essay but was thinking about entropy as it would relate to sharing ATTYL snippet or whatever. advantage of being in my position is there are so many possiblities. If you are established artist release to to be perfect because you can't put the cat back in the bag
- Realistically I don't think there is anyone in the target audience who would be impressed or amused by this app
- Slowing down and thinking about software comes back to the WEMI concept. You have to think long and hard about what it is
- Cybernetic loop: Sense, Update, Act
  - Why startups are boring; ultimately postured towards enshittification
- Song becomes real when it attaches itself to a higher abstract concept
- Ask AI to update my "manifesto" but just use my new ideas
- Maybe do a video production version of this, hire actor

- I did find that AI almost actively makes me "lazy". In the sense that even if I have a desire to put effort into something, still that required effort compared to the ease of AI almost feel absurd. Like usually cutting corners means like saving a few minutes on a long project. That math changes when I high effort thing basically goes to 0.

- Maybe make the AI generation of this a secret message, not an actual generation. Kind of ARG vibes (though I don't like ARG term, it's all good fun)

## OUTLINE: THE ESCALATION LADDER

_The essay starts LinkedIn-cheesy and gradually climbs until I'm suddenly talking about death and the reader doesn't quite know how they got there. Each step feels like a natural "and this made me think about..."_

---

### LEVEL 1: LinkedIn Mode

**"Welcome, let me explain this app"**

- Thank you for reading, welcome to Expressions
- I don't love writing, especially the final 10% where you bring everything together
- Had notes and concepts for these core ideas, but no appetite to actually write the essays
- AI made it tempting to just generate something from the notes
- Detailed notes + conceptual overview = coherent LLM output. We all know this.
- I was tempted to just... do that. Generate the essays. Better than nothing.
- **The laziness effect**: AI almost actively makes me "lazy"—not lacking desire, but the effort calculus changes
  - Usually cutting corners saves a few minutes on a long project
  - But when a high-effort thing goes to basically zero effort, even small effort feels absurd
  - The math that used to make sense (put in work → get result) breaks when the alternative is instant

**→ TRANSITION: "But that felt a little weak, which led me to..."**

---

### LEVEL 2: Pivot

**"Why not let the user generate it?"**

- If I'm going to have AI generate these essays anyway with inadequate oversight...
- ...why not at least let the _user_ have some influence over the output?
- This creates a balance: not pure AI slop, but guided, participatory assistance
- Key point: it doesn't need to be "my voice"—it's about communicating ideas, not individual expression
- Connects to the broader project: collaboration, community, open contribution (contributing.md)
- The concepts and notes are the singular vision; personalized generation could be fine

**→ TRANSITION: "But even with participation, you still need something real..."**

---

### LEVEL 2.5: The Organic Touchpoint

**"This essay is the anchor"**

- Even with user participation, you still need one human anchor
- AI content without grounding feels weightless—"slop"
- This essay is that anchor: something real that holds the project together
- It opens everything up—now you can use the app, explore the ideas, without it feeling ridiculous
- One organic touchpoint gives permission for the rest to exist
- _(This is also the "double meta": writing an essay about the app that generates essays—grounding it in honest reflection)_

**→ TRANSITION: "This also made me think about what a 'work' even is..."**

---

### LEVEL 3: Getting Philosophical

**"What is a work anyway?" (Ship of Theseus)**

- What makes a song a song? The melody? The audio waves? The lyrics?
- To me, a song becomes real when it attaches to a **higher abstract concept**
- You can swap parts over time—completely different, but still the same song
- The question isn't "what stays the same?"—it's "what persists through change?"
- Every Work should have this abstract essence—the thing that endures
- Then it can be made real in many **expressions** (hence the app name)

**→ TRANSITION: "This applies to software too. What is this app, really?"**

---

### LEVEL 4: Philosophy of Software

**"What is software? What am I even building?"**

- Didn't write one line of code, didn't even look at it
- When you use AI you just keep going—tendency to move too fast
- Hard to slow down and think about what you're making
- Makes you confront: what is software actually _for_?
- What does software actually _do_?
  - Coordinates people
  - Encodes memory
  - Extends cognition
  - Creates structure that persists
- That's what it's _for_. But when you move fast, you forget this. You ship features instead of asking if they actually do any of that.
- WEMI concept applied to software—you have to think long and hard about what it is

**→ TRANSITION: "And this isn't just me—look at the whole system..."**

---

### LEVEL 4.5: The Thermodynamic Problem

**"Speed serves machines, not humans"**

- This is a systems observation, not a moral judgment
- The AI productivity craze: people bragging about output, "creating value"
- But fast toward _what_? The speed, the value, the productivity—thermodynamically, it serves machines. Automation. Elimination of human viability.
- Startups are boring because to survive they must be profit-generating machines—oriented toward enshittification from the start
- Most tech people aren't evil, they're just not slowing down to ask: does this serve humans or does it serve the machines?
- _(This connects to The Living System: there's a ceiling. Exceed humanness and there's no subject left to experience anything.)_

**→ TRANSITION: "So what's the corrective? This is where taste comes in..."**

---

### LEVEL 5: What Is Taste?

**"Taste is compression—but toward what?"**

- "Taste" can sound exclusionary
- But through the lens of **information compression** it has real function
- With AI, anyone can generate infinite content. Taste is what compresses that—deciding what matters.
- **But compression requires a target. Compression toward _what_?**
  - SV/startup taste: compresses toward engagement, profit, "value creation" → enshittification
  - The productivity bros aren't tasteless—their taste is calibrated to the wrong target
  - They have taste for what ships fast, what gets funding, what looks impressive. That's compression. But it's compressing toward machine-serving outcomes.
- **The taste I'm talking about is calibrated toward beauty, human flourishing, viability**
- This is why slowing down matters—you have to ask what target you're compressing toward
- **Cybernetic loop**: Sense → Update → Act. Most systems skip the Update (the thinking, the asking, the "toward what?").

**→ TRANSITION: "And if beauty is the target... what is beauty, actually?"**

---

### LEVEL 6: Beauty = Art = Compression

**"What is beauty, actually?"**

- Taste oriented toward beauty—but what _is_ beauty?
- Compression toward what matters. Art as information compression.
- The machinic/organic dichotomy in the app's theme reflects this: organic = what matters to humans, machinic = what serves machines
- Beauty is what the living system is _for_—the thing that makes viability worth preserving
- But "viability" is a clinical word. What does it actually mean?

**→ TRANSITION: "Viability means persistence. So what does it mean to persist?"**

---

### LEVEL 7: The Systems Turn

**"What does it mean to persist?"**

- A viable system is one that persists. It maintains coherence over time.
- We've been talking about this: feedback loops, structure, memory that endures
- When a system can no longer reproduce itself—when the loops break down—it ceases to exist
- This is just thermodynamics. Entropy. Nothing dramatic.
- A company dissolves. A codebase rots. A tradition fades. Systems end.

**→ TRANSITION: "But when the system is a person..."**

---

### LEVEL 7.5: The Reveal

**"We have another word for it"**

- But when the system that ceases to persist is a person—someone you know—we have another word for it
- We call it death
- And suddenly the clinical framing doesn't help anymore
- The systems language was always a way of not saying it directly
- _(We've been talking about this the whole time. You knew that, right?)_

**→ TRANSITION: No transition. We're here now.**

---

### LEVEL 8: The Abyss

**"I think about death a lot"**

- Not morbid. Just... sitting with it.
- When someone dies, you never speak to them again. Not one word. For the rest of time. It is over.
  - The immediate loss, and the long-term finality—the forever of it
  - _(see: [24 Remix])_ — just a casual inline link, wiki-style. The remix flips the tone from hopeful gospel to existential dread just by changing the beat. Don't explain it, just drop it.
- This isn't pessimism. It's what's true. If you really feel it, it's chilling.
- The systems framing got us here, but it can't stay. Now we're just talking about loss.

---

### LEVEL 9: The Answer (The Ideas Emerge)

**"So what makes it worthwhile?"**

- **Beauty Redeems**: Moments where time stops. Absorption, presence, stillness.

  - A cathedral. Holding your child. Creation so complete the self dissolves.
  - For that duration, you're outside the arrow. This is the only "beating entropy" possible.
  - A life with enough such moments was worth living despite death.

- **The Living System**: But who experiences beauty?

  - We're hybrid—biological + synthetic. Floor and ceiling. Navigate the viable range.

- **Love of Fate**: What blocks presence?

  - Regret. "If only..." You can't be present while fractured by comparison.
  - Acceptance isn't resignation—it's prerequisite.

- **Capital as Medium**: How do you create at scale?

  - We're already part-synthetic. Orchestrate capital toward beauty, not extraction.

- **Axioms**: What holds it together?
  - "To live beautifully is to affirm being."

---

### LEVEL 10: The Honest Admission

**"Yes, this is dramatic"**

- These ideas go to the depths of my soul
- "Cringe" is a weak emotion (link to cringe essay)
- No guarantee of transcendence
- But I believe through understanding, through building things that create conditions for these moments—something can emerge
- Will be as sincere as needed because this matters

---

### LEVEL 11: Landing / Close

**"Try out the app now!"**

- **All the Things You Love**: Current best plan to produce something _(see: [ATTYL])_
  - Entropy concept: advantage of being unknown = many possibilities
  - Established artists can't put the cat back in the bag
- Realistically, probably no one in target audience would be "impressed"
- But that's not the point
- This is a working piece of the larger system

_[24 Remix already dropped as inline link in Level 8—don't repeat]_

---

## STRUCTURE: TWO-REGISTER SKETCH

_Main text escalates from LinkedIn → existential. Asides are already at the existential level from the start, muttering underneath. As the main text catches up, they merge._

---

### LEVEL 1

**Main text:**

> Thank you for reading, welcome to Expressions. I don't love writing, especially the final 10% where you bring everything together. Had notes and concepts but no appetite to actually write. AI made it tempting to just generate something. The effort calculus changed—when the alternative is zero effort, even small effort feels absurd.

**Aside:**

> _(I keep thinking about endings. Not yet, we're not there. But I want you to know it's coming. And I wonder: does the ease make me forget what effort is for?)_

---

### LEVEL 2

**Main text:**

> If I'm going to have AI generate these essays anyway... why not let the user have some influence? This creates a balance. It doesn't need to be "my voice"—it's about communicating ideas.

**Aside:**

> _(Voice. As if that matters. As if any of this will matter when—no. Keep going.)_

---

### LEVEL 2.5

**Main text:**

> Even with participation, you need one human anchor. AI content without grounding feels weightless. This essay is that anchor.

**Aside:**

> _(The anchor. The thing that makes everything else float instead of drown. You need something real. At least one.)_

---

### LEVEL 3

**Main text:**

> What makes a song a song? The melody? The audio waves? To me, a song becomes real when it attaches to a higher abstract concept. You can swap parts over time—completely different—but it still embodies that original concept. The question isn't "what stays the same?" It's "what persists through change?"

**Aside:**

> _(The song outlives the singer. The concept outlives the form. What survives? What's the thing that doesn't die?)_

---

### LEVEL 4

**Main text:**

> I didn't write one line of code. When you use AI you just keep going. What is software actually for? It coordinates people. Encodes memory. Creates structure that persists.

**Aside:**

> _(Persists. Structure that persists. That's what we're really talking about, isn't it?)_

---

### LEVEL 4.5

**Main text:**

> The speed, the value, the productivity—thermodynamically, it serves machines. Elimination of human viability. Most tech people aren't evil, they're just not slowing down to ask.

**Aside:**

> _(Viability. The word we use when we mean "continuing to exist." When we mean "not dying.")_

---

### LEVEL 5

**Main text:**

> Taste is compression—but toward what? The productivity bros aren't tasteless. Their taste is calibrated to the wrong target. The taste I'm talking about is calibrated toward beauty.

**Aside:**

> _(Love. The only thing that ever mattered. Getting closer now. Keep saying beauty though)_

---

### LEVEL 6

**Main text:**

> Taste oriented toward beauty—but what is beauty? Compression toward what matters. Beauty is what the living system is for—the thing that makes viability worth preserving. But "viability" is a clinical word. What does it actually mean?

**Aside:**

> _(For. The living system is FOR something. Not just surviving. Actually for something. But what does "surviving" mean? We keep circling it.)_

---

### LEVEL 7

**Main text:**

> A viable system is one that persists. It maintains coherence over time. When the loops break down, the system ceases to exist. This is just thermodynamics. Nothing dramatic.

**Aside:**

> _(We've been circling this. You feel it, right? The word we're avoiding.)_

---

### LEVEL 7.5 — THE REVEAL

**Main text:**

> But when the system that ceases to persist is a person—someone you know—we have another word for it. We call it death. And suddenly the clinical framing doesn't help anymore.

**Aside:**

> _(There it is. We've been talking about this the whole time.)_

---

### LEVEL 8 — THE MERGE

_The reveal already happened. Now the main text and asides converge. The voice drops the professional register entirely. The systems language did its job—it got us here—but now we're just talking about loss._

**Main text (no more asides needed):**

> I think about death a lot. Not in a morbid way. Just... sitting with it. When someone dies, you never speak to them again. Not one word. For the rest of time. It is over.
>
> _(see: [24 Remix])_
>
> This isn't pessimism. It's what's true. If you really feel it, it's chilling.

---

### LEVEL 9+

_The essay continues in the merged voice—personal, sincere, no longer hiding behind the professional register. The asides did their job: they prepared the reader for where we were always going._

---

## THE EFFECT

1. **Early asides**: Reader notices something's off. "Why is this person muttering about endings?"
2. **Tension builds**: The main text is professional, but the asides keep tugging toward something darker
3. **The systems reveal (Level 7.5)**: The clinical language about "persistence" and "systems ceasing to exist" suddenly becomes personal—"oh, we've been talking about death this whole time." The abstraction was a way of not saying it directly.
4. **The merge**: After the reveal, the main text drops the professional register entirely. The asides were foreshadowing, and now there's nothing left to hide behind.
5. **Meta-point**: The essay is about the gap between how we present ourselves (main text) and what we're actually thinking (asides). The systems language mirrors this—it's the acceptable way to talk about unacceptable things. This also mirrors the app: organic notes (asides) vs. generated essays (main text).

---

## NOTES FOR LATER

- Maybe do a video production version, hire actor
- Ask AI to update manifesto with new ideas

---

## IMPLEMENTATION NOTES (WEB/REACT)

**The double meta clarified:**

1. Meta 1: The app generates essays about ideas
2. Meta 2: This essay is about the app
3. Meta 3: This essay can _also_ be generated by the app (as an artifact)

The asides only exist in the organic version—they're what makes it organic. When a user generates their personalized version, no asides. That's the difference.

**Aside styling (CSS):**

```css
.aside {
  font-style: italic;
  opacity: 0.8;
  margin: 1rem 0;
  padding-left: 1rem;
  border-left: 2px solid rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.3);
}
```

Or inline with parentheses:

```css
.aside-inline {
  font-style: italic;
  opacity: 0.7;
}
```

**Structure options:**

- New route: `/essay` or `/reflection`
- Or integrate into Landing page as scrollable content before entering the app
- Or: essay is the first thing you see when you enter Expressions, before artifact selection

**The asides format (for React):**

```tsx
<p>
  Thank you for reading, welcome to Expressions. I don't love writing, especially the final 10%.
</p>
<p className="aside">
  I keep thinking about endings. Not yet—we're not there. But I want you to know it's coming.
</p>
<p>
  AI made it tempting to just generate something.
</p>
```

**At the merge (Level 8):**

- Asides stop
- Main text drops into the personal register
- Maybe a visual cue: the aside styling fades or the main text takes on aside qualities

---

## CROSS-PLATFORM PUBLISHING

**Strategy: Markdown as source of truth**

Write the essay in markdown with aside syntax that:

1. Renders beautifully on your site (custom CSS)
2. Degrades gracefully on other platforms (italics + block quotes)

**Portable aside format:**

```markdown
Thank you for reading, welcome to Expressions. I don't love writing.

> _I keep thinking about endings. Not yet—we're not there. But I want you to know it's coming._

AI made it tempting to just generate something.
```

**Platform breakdown:**

| Platform            | How asides render                                      |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Your site**       | Full styled treatment (border, opacity, custom font)   |
| **Medium/Substack** | Block quote + italics—still visually distinct          |
| **LinkedIn**        | Italics only (block quotes weak), may skip some asides |
| **Twitter/X**       | Separate tweets for asides, or inline _(like this)_    |
| **PDF/Print**       | Full control—match site styling                        |

**Workflow:**

1. Write once in markdown with `> *aside text*` format
2. Your React site parses `> *...*` blocks and applies `.aside` class
3. For other platforms, copy-paste—block quote italics still convey two voices
4. For Twitter, adapt separately (different medium, different rules)

---

Hello there, if anyone is reading these words I very much appreciate it. The goal of this piece I suppose is to share my simple experience of creating an AI app with AI. As the title implies, I did it and then really started to think about it. While this is just a small, uninspiring endeavor, I do believe this relates to my larger project. And I think this can be a microcosm of that project, so without further ado, allow me to get into it.

I can't say that I love writing. Particular the last 10%. I can get my thoughts into the page, but refining it into a satisfactory whole is simply not the most enjoyable, to me. While starting my project (Vital Systems), that disposition left me with some of the core concepts, fairly comprehensive notes, but little desire to actually write any essays. With not a high priority on this work, AI did make it tempting to simply generate something form the conceptual overview and the notes. As we know, that should be enough to generate a coherent LLM output. Probably not something I would be particularly proud of, but something that felt at least better than nothing. My aversion to producing polished writing was at least partially solved, enough to maybe get some thoughts into the world. And one interesting affect of AI is how it changes the lazines calculus. There used to be no sense in cutting corners on a high effort project, because great effort was already sunk in. But when the required effort to produce something goes to almost zero, even small effort feels worthless {Note: Please explain this math better}.

But that whole approach felt a little weak. If I was contemplating simply generating something with inadequate oversight, why not just let the user have some influence over the output? I think such an approach actually does capture a somewhat interesting approach towards AI. Not pure meaningless output, it starts from a human generated idea, but can smoothen out the communication in a way that can give the user an opportunity to better connect with the initial human symbol. Of course if there is some extreme aversion or disagreement with that foundation then there may be no common ground, which fine for this iteration. And this connects to a key idea of my larger project, the writing does not need to be "my voice", it is about communicating ideas, not individual expression. Collaboration, community, and open contribution are important. {Note: I feel like I should somehow mention targeted advertising. I would be remiss not to mention that sort of existing use case and I guess defuse it a bit? Something like "Now of course this sort of technique is pretty widely used in advertising, politics etc."}

So even with user participation in that sense, you still need something "real". So this essay itself is actually a core mechanism in the application. This is written in my voice, and serves as the real human anchor. Without this grounding everything feels sort of weightless, but this touchpoint can kind of serve as a strong foundation upon which things can grow, and AI can be used to enhance and build coordination. This helps turn the medium into the message so to speak. An honest reflection on AI helps validate engaging with the ideas even if the particular expression is AI generated.

But this sort of project ended up making think about what a "work" really is. This is something that I have encountered before in my adventures creating music. What makes a song a song? The melody? The audio waves? The bytes? Words on a page {Phrase this more interestingly}? To me, a song becomes real when it attaches to some sort of higher abstract concept. Even though in a practical sense, yes the song I am working is pretty much the files that come to life in the audio production software, it really become a song when there is a strong concept, and it feels like something abstract. In that sense you can swap parts over time until everything is completely different, like the Ship of Theseus, but the concept had solidifed {Could link to Higher or something. What is my most Ship of Theseus song??} The question isn't "what stays the same?" it's what "persists through change?" Every Work, or Artifact as I currently refer to them, should have this abstract essence. The thing that endures. Then it can made real in many different expressions, hence the name of the app.

This doesn't only apply to songs and writing, it applies to software too. What is this app really? For this one, I certainly did not write one line of code. Or do much of anything. Key decions made: started with vanilla.js, but I asked LLM what it preferred so switched to React. Edge function. But I have found when using AI that it creates a tendency to almost move too fast. As I said earlier, you can just go. Of course you can quickly test hypotheses etc., but I think without much thought you get caught up in certain heuristics and have a tendency to ultimately serve one purpose. Humans are also slow, hypotheses with visible financial value will dominate without mechanisms for negative feedback. What happens if you confront what software ius actually for... {need to clean this paragraph up}

This isn't just me, this applies to the whole system... red queen race...

So what is the corrective? This is where taste come into play..

What is beauty actually?

If viability means persistence, what does it mean to persist?

But when the system is a person, we have another word for it.

The most haunting thought

So what makes it worthwhile? Those are the ideas you will find in this app.
