# The Genius Myth

## Artifact Concept

This folder contains an essay responding to the widespread discomfort with AI-generated art and the "lone genius" narrative that underlies it.

The hypothesis: the reaction to AI art reveals more about modern assumptions than about AI itself. The intensity suggests something deeper is being threatened—something about identity, meaning, authorship.

## The Core Argument

1. The "lone artistic genius" is a modern construct, not a timeless truth
2. Historically, art was viewed as craft and skill; beauty was understood as divine in origin
3. Rationalism and secularization required relocating the source of beauty—it moved from God to the individual genius
4. But the genius myth doesn't hold up: everyone iterates on existing ideas, builds from tradition, borrows forms
5. The "lone genius" is more marketing narrative than description of how creation actually works
6. AI art disrupts the marketing, not the reality
7. Moving past individualistic framing reopens access to raw sublime beauty
8. This may actually enable more communal modes of organization and action

## Case Study: The Incoherence

The essay includes a case study examining how people embedded in industrial creative systems invoke "true art" principles against AI—despite already participating in algorithmic, capital-driven, distributed-authorship processes.

This reveals the genius myth functioning as ideology: cover for a system that depends on named geniuses for marketing while producing work through fundamentally collective, iterative, capital-orchestrated means.

## Genius vs. Experiencer

A key distinction:
- **Genius (myth)**: some people have special creative power that originates beauty
- **Experiencer (real)**: all humans have perceptual capacity for beauty

Clearing the genius myth doesn't flatten experience—it opens access. Beauty is not made by special people; it is perceived by everyone.

## Connection to Broader Project

- **Capital as Medium**: The genius is a system position, not an intrinsic quality. This essay clears the false framing.
- **Axioms**: "Creation is devotion"—not self-expression but offering
- **The Living System**: The hybrid condition includes being part of collective creative systems, not isolated originating geniuses

## Status

This artifact is speculative. The essay is not yet written; these notes capture the hypothesis to be developed.
