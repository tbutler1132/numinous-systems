# The Trunk Model

## Artifact Concept

This folder contains a practical framework for collaborative creative work that applies version control wisdom to music, writing, visual art, and software.

The core claim: **Progress comes from committing to a direction and refining it, not from keeping all options open.**

This is not a productivity framework. It's a way to keep creative work honest, collaborative, and alive.

## What This Artifact Addresses

- The necessity of a canonical version—why work stalls without a clear "trunk"
- The purpose-driven branch—why vague exploration kills momentum
- The integration problem—why merging is the core creative act, not an afterthought
- The ownership question—why parallel exploration works but parallel decision-making does not
- Creative merge conflicts—loss of clarity, competing directions, emotional flatness, aesthetic overload
- The difference between flexibility and avoidance

## The Core Insight

The goal is not control. The goal is to keep work moving forward.

Most collaborative creative work fails not from disagreement but from ambiguity: What is the real version? Who decides? What stays, what goes? The Trunk Model makes these questions explicit rather than leaving them to fester.

A version becomes real when it is chosen and carried forward. Perpetual exploration is not flexibility—it is avoidance.

## Connection to Broader Project

- **The Living System**: Creative collaboration is a hybrid system—multiple people must coordinate without destroying individual voice
- **Beauty Redeems**: The framework serves one purpose: enabling the work to reach moments of beauty rather than dying in indecision
- **Capital as Medium**: This is methodology for orchestrating effort toward finished artifacts rather than infinite drafts
- **Continuity of Intention**: The trunk is a prosthetic for collective intention—without it, the group loses coherence

## Status

This artifact is conceptually complete. The notes contain the full framework as a reference document.
