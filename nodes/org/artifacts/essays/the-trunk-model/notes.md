# The Trunk Model

A practical framework for collaborative creative work

---

This is a simple system for doing creative work without losing momentum, clarity, or coherence. It applies to music, writing, visual art, and software.

**The goal is not control.
The goal is to keep work moving forward.**

---

## 1. Always Maintain a Trunk

There is always one canonical version of the work.

- This is the version we treat as "real"
- This is the version we listen to, read, or review
- This is the version we build from

It does not need to be finished or polished.
It does need to be coherent and up to date.

**If there is no clear trunk, work stalls.**

---

## 2. Branch With a Purpose

Exploration is encouraged, but it must be scoped.

A branch should answer a specific question, such as:

- What if the tempo is slower?
- What if the chorus drops instead of lifts?
- What if the visual palette is colder?

Avoid vague branches like "experiment" or "improve this."

**Branches are temporary by design.**

---

## 3. Keep Branches Short-Lived

The longer a branch lives:

- the more assumptions it makes
- the harder it is to integrate
- the more political decisions become

Branches should be reviewed and resolved quickly:

- integrate what works
- discard the rest
- move on

**Most branches exist to inform the trunk, not replace it.**

---

## 4. One Person Owns Integration

At any given time, one person is responsible for:

- integrating changes
- resolving conflicts
- protecting the work's coherence

This role may rotate between projects, but not simultaneously.

**Parallel exploration works.
Parallel decision-making does not.**

---

## 5. Integration Is Selective, Not Additive

Merging does not mean "include everything."

Integration often involves:

- removing good ideas that don't fit
- rebalancing the whole
- adjusting surrounding elements

**If integration feels hard, that's normal.
It's the core creative act.**

---

## 6. Expect Merge Conflicts

Creative conflicts are normal.

They show up as:

- loss of clarity
- competing directions
- emotional flatness
- aesthetic overload

These conflicts cannot be resolved automatically.
They require judgment and taste.

**Ignoring them creates confusion later.**

---

## 7. Protect the Trunk

Some elements should not be changed casually:

- core structure
- overall direction
- central emotional intent

**If a branch touches these, it should be explicit and deliberate.**

---

## 8. Move Forward Through Commitment

Progress comes from committing to a direction and refining it, not from keeping all options open.

A version becomes real when it is chosen and carried forward.

**Perpetual exploration is not flexibility.
It is avoidance.**

---

## Summary

- One trunk
- Many short-lived branches
- Clear ownership of integration
- Regular merging
- Forward motion over perfection

**This is not a rigid workflow.
It is a way to keep creative work honest, collaborative, and alive.**
