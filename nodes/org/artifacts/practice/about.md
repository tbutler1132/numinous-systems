# Practice

Operational frameworks meant to be used, not just understood.

These are methodologies for action—ways of working that can be implemented in concrete situations. Unlike essays (which argue) or reference material (which is consulted), practice artifacts are prescriptive: they tell you what to do.

Practice artifacts share common traits:

- They are actionable without further interpretation
- They address recurring situations (collaboration, review, integration)
- They embody judgment that would otherwise need to be reinvented each time
- They can be refined through use
