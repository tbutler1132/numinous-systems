# The Trunk Model

## Artifact Concept

This folder contains a practical framework for collaborative creative work that applies version control wisdom to music, writing, visual art, and software.

The core claim: **Progress comes from committing to a direction and refining it, not from keeping all options open.**

This is not a productivity framework. It's a way to keep creative work honest, collaborative, and alive.

## What This Artifact Addresses

- The necessity of a canonical version—why work stalls without a clear "trunk"
- The purpose-driven branch—why vague exploration kills momentum
- The integration problem—why merging is the core creative act, not an afterthought
- The ownership question—why parallel exploration works but parallel decision-making does not
- Creative merge conflicts—loss of clarity, competing directions, emotional flatness, aesthetic overload
- The difference between flexibility and avoidance
- The fractal nature of digital artifacts—how the model applies recursively from page to element to source

## The Core Insight

The goal is not control. The goal is to keep work moving forward.

Most collaborative creative work fails not from disagreement but from ambiguity: What is the real version? Who decides? What stays, what goes? The Trunk Model makes these questions explicit rather than leaving them to fester.

In the digital world, creative work is decomposable—a song is a page containing elements generated from sources. The Trunk Model applies at every level of this tree, ready to handle whatever depth of collaboration emerges.

## Connection to Broader Project

- **The Living System**: Creative collaboration is a hybrid system—multiple people must coordinate without destroying individual voice
- **Beauty Redeems**: The framework serves one purpose: enabling the work to reach moments of beauty rather than dying in indecision
- **Capital as Medium**: This is methodology for orchestrating effort toward finished artifacts rather than infinite drafts
- **Continuity of Intention**: The trunk is a prosthetic for collective intention—without it, the group loses coherence

## Status

This artifact is conceptually complete. The notes contain the full framework as a reference document, including the extension to fractal/recursive application across page, element, and source layers.
