# The Trunk Model

A practical framework for collaborative creative work

---

This is a simple system for doing creative work without losing momentum, clarity, or coherence. It applies to music, writing, visual art, and software.

**The goal is not control.
The goal is to keep work moving forward.**

---

## 1. Always Maintain a Trunk

There is always one canonical version of the work.

- This is the version we treat as "real"
- This is the version we listen to, read, or review
- This is the version we build from

It does not need to be finished or polished.
It does need to be coherent and up to date.

**If there is no clear trunk, work stalls.**

---

## 2. Branch With a Purpose

Exploration is encouraged, but it must be scoped.

A branch should answer a specific question, such as:

- What if the tempo is slower?
- What if the chorus drops instead of lifts?
- What if the visual palette is colder?

Avoid vague branches like "experiment" or "improve this."

**Branches are temporary by design.**

---

## 3. Keep Branches Short-Lived

The longer a branch lives:

- the more assumptions it makes
- the harder it is to integrate
- the more political decisions become

Branches should be reviewed and resolved quickly:

- integrate what works
- discard the rest
- move on

**Most branches exist to inform the trunk, not replace it.**

---

## 4. One Person Owns Integration

At any given time, one person is responsible for:

- integrating changes
- resolving conflicts
- protecting the work's coherence

This role may rotate between projects, but not simultaneously.

**Parallel exploration works.
Parallel decision-making does not.**

---

## 5. Integration Is Selective, Not Additive

Merging does not mean "include everything."

Integration often involves:

- removing good ideas that don't fit
- rebalancing the whole
- adjusting surrounding elements

**If integration feels hard, that's normal.
It's the core creative act.**

---

## 6. Expect Merge Conflicts

Creative conflicts are normal.

They show up as:

- loss of clarity
- competing directions
- emotional flatness
- aesthetic overload

These conflicts cannot be resolved automatically.
They require judgment and taste.

**Ignoring them creates confusion later.**

---

## 7. Protect the Trunk

Some elements should not be changed casually:

- core structure
- overall direction
- central emotional intent

**If a branch touches these, it should be explicit and deliberate.**

---

## 8. Move Forward Through Commitment

Progress comes from committing to a direction and refining it, not from keeping all options open.

A version becomes real when it is chosen and carried forward.

**Perpetual exploration is not flexibility.
It is avoidance.**

---

## Summary

- One trunk
- Many short-lived branches
- Clear ownership of integration
- Regular merging
- Forward motion over perfection

**This is not a rigid workflow.
It is a way to keep creative work honest, collaborative, and alive.**

## 9. The Fractal Nature of Digital Artifacts

In the digital world, creative work is decomposable. A song is not a single object—it is a tree:

- **Page**: The presentation layer (cover art, audio player, notes, lyrics)
- **Elements**: The components embedded in the page (the audio file, the image)
- **Sources**: The generative files that produce elements (Ableton project, Photoshop file)

The Trunk Model applies recursively at every level.

```
page/
  trunk/           ← canonical arrangement of elements
  branches/        ← "what if we add a video element?"

elements/
  audio/
    trunk/         ← canonical mix
    branches/      ← "what if the bass is louder?"
    source/
      trunk/       ← canonical project file
      branches/    ← "what if the tempo is slower?"
  
  cover/
    trunk/         ← canonical image
    branches/      ← "what if it's darker?"
    source/
      trunk/       ← canonical PSD/Figma file
      branches/    ← "what if different typography?"
```

**Most of the time, you are only actively branching at one level.** When collaborating on a song, you might branch only at the source level (the Ableton project). The page and elements remain stable until you have something worth promoting.

But the structure allows collaboration at any depth. Someone wants to branch just the cover art? Allowed. Someone wants to branch the whole page to add a video element? Also allowed. The model scales up and down.

**This is aligned with the modern world.**

Physical media was fixed—a record, a tape, a print. Collaboration happened before the object existed. Then it was done.

Digital media is:

- Decomposable (page → elements → sources)
- Versionable (every layer can have history)
- Forkable (anyone can branch at any level)
- Never truly "done" (the trunk can always evolve)

The Trunk Model makes this explicit rather than pretending the old model still applies.

**In practice:**

You do not explain this to collaborators. You say "we're working on a song." But underneath, the structure is there—ready to handle whatever depth of collaboration emerges.
