# Reference

## Category Concept

This folder contains **theoretical frameworks and legacy systems** — mature thinking to consult, not follow.

Reference materials are not doctrine. They are resources: invariants to check against, guardrails to notice when crossed, patterns that proved useful in earlier contexts. They inform without commanding.

## What This Category Addresses

- What mature thinking exists that might prevent drift?
- What invariants should trigger review when violated?
- What patterns from other contexts might apply here?
- How do you preserve wisdom without calcifying into rules?

## Relationship to Core

Core philosophy is active — it shapes decisions and priorities. Reference is consultative — it provides checkpoints and warnings.

The distinction matters. Core says "this is what we believe." Reference says "when you find yourself here, consider this."

## Current Reference Materials

| Reference                          | Function                                                     |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Becoming Engine Doctrine**       | Cybernetic system — invariants, guardrails, mature thinking  |
| **Canon, Projections, and Becoming** | Architectural philosophy — what the repo is, how truth relates to views |
| **Constitution of Viable Beauty**  | *(framework for sustainable aesthetic practice)*             |

## When to Consult

Reference is useful when:

- Making architectural decisions that are hard to reverse
- Noticing patterns that feel like drift or scope creep
- Asking "are we optimizing when we should be satisficing?"
- Wondering if a current approach conflicts with past learning

## Status

Reference materials are stable by nature. They may be extended but rarely revised.
