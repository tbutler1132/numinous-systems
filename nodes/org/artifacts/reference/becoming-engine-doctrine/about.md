# Becoming Engine Doctrine

## Artifact Concept

This folder contains the **Becoming Engine Doctrine** — a fully developed cybernetic framework from an earlier iteration of systems thinking. It serves as a **reference doctrine**, not a specification or roadmap.

The doctrine articulates a complete philosophy of regulation, learning, and bounded intervention for individuals and organizations operating under uncertainty.

## What This Artifact IS

- A mature expression of cybernetic principles
- A set of invariants and guardrails to check against
- A theoretical reference for how a system *could* work at full development
- A source of concepts that may inform (not dictate) the current project

## What This Artifact Is NOT

- A specification to implement
- A commitment or roadmap
- A measure of adequacy for the current system
- Doctrine that must be followed

The current system should evolve naturally. This reference exists to provide consistency checks ("are we drifting into optimization?", "are we creating permanent mobilization?") — not to constrain what gets built.

## Key Concepts Worth Referencing

**Core Invariants:**
- Viability over optimization
- Baseline quiet as success state
- Episodes as finite, closeable interventions
- Explicit learning (if no Model changes, learning hasn't occurred)
- Anti-capture: no feature may turn a person into an optimized resource inside a loop they don't control

**Structural Ideas:**
- Variables (regulated dimensions of viability)
- Episodes (Stabilize / Explore)
- Models (explicit beliefs — descriptive, procedural, normative)
- Actions (disposable execution units with no intrinsic meaning)

**Posture:**
- Idleness is a success state
- Ambition through viability, not despite it
- Automation serves homeostasis, never identity or growth

## Connection to Broader Project

This artifact connects to the philosophy:

- **The Living System**: the doctrine operationalizes "preserve the hybrid subject" through regulatory architecture
- **Capital as Medium**: the anti-capture boundary ensures capital serves creation, not extraction
- **Beauty Redeems**: the doctrine protects the conditions for beauty by preventing collapse and permanent mobilization

## Status

This artifact is **stable as reference**. It will not be developed further — it exists to be consulted, not extended.

If concepts from this doctrine are adopted, they should be integrated into the current system's own models, not imported wholesale.
