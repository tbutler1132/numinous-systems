# Canon Interfaces

> How different encounters with the same canon relate to each other.

This document complements `notes.md` (the architectural model) by focusing on the experiential side: how interfaces expose canon without creating multiple truths.

---

## First Principle: One Substrate

There is **one canonical substrate**.

There are not separate layers of truth for:
- surface
- process
- collaboration
- reflection

All of these interact with the **same underlying canon**.

Differences between experiences come from:
- permissions
- state
- intent
- presentation

Not from different realities.

---

## Interfaces (Not Layers)

The system should be understood as **multiple interfaces over the same canon**, not stacked layers that build on each other.

Each interface answers four questions differently:

1. What can be seen?
2. What can be changed?
3. What context is revealed?
4. How is it framed aesthetically?

Interfaces are orthogonal. None is more real than another.

## Common Interface Patterns

### 1. Polished Surface

**Purpose:** Experience

- Shows only finished, authorized works
- Read-only
- Public
- Minimal context
- Clean, aesthetic, intentional

This interface exists for first impressions and consumption.

Nothing here is fabricated. Everything shown exists in canon.

---

### 2. Workshop / Collaborative

**Purpose:** Participation

- Shows unfinished or in-progress works
- Allows comments, suggestions, edits (permissioned)
- Reveals partial history and context
- Still curated, but less precious

This interface enables collaboration without creating a separate reality.

---

### 3. Canonical / Transparent

**Purpose:** Accountability

- Full history
- Raw files
- Rules and processes visible
- Minimal narrative framing

This interface is not optimized for beauty or ease. It exists so the system can be inspected and trusted.

---

## Release Is a Permission Change

There is no metaphysical jump between:
- a demo
- a work-in-progress
- a finished release

They are the same object evolving through state.

Release means:
- visibility changes
- permissions change
- the work is authorized as complete (for now)

Creation and release are distinct acts.

---

## Transparency and Curation

The system supports both:

- **Curated surfaces** for clarity and beauty
- **Deep transparency** for trust and accountability

Curation selects a subset of reality.

Propaganda invents a fake one.

This system only allows the former.

---

## The Floor

The recursion stops at commitment and experience.

- A file is written
- A rule is accepted
- A song is listened to

Reflection can continue forever.

Authority does not.

---

## Core Invariants

These statements should remain true as the system evolves:

- There is only one canon
- Interfaces do not create new truths
- Everything above canon is projection
- Everything below canon is reality
- Process is content once made explicit
- Release is authorization, not creation

If these hold, the system remains coherent.
