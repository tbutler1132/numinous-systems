# The Constitution of Viable Beauty

## Artifact Concept

This document is the **political translation** of the core artifacts.

The core artifacts address fundamental questions: What makes existence worthwhile? What are humans? How do we relate to loss? What is capital? These are philosophical foundations.

This constitution asks: **What do these foundations mean for political, economic, and technological systems?**

It provides a "thin ideology"—minimal commitments that constrain what systems we should build, without prescribing a complete political program.

## What This Artifact Addresses

- How to judge political and economic systems (by whether they preserve conditions for redemptive experience)
- Physical reality as hard constraint on politics
- Viability over optimization as system design principle
- Markets and capital as tools requiring boundaries
- The anti-corruption clause: this framework forbids its own hardening

## Relationship to Core Artifacts

| Core Artifact | Constitutional Translation |
|---------------|---------------------------|
| **Beauty Redeems** | Beauty as the criterion for judging all systems (Article IV) |
| **The Living System** | Floor/ceiling of humanness as system constraints (Article III); community as infrastructure (Article VIII) |
| **Love of Fate** | Implied: no utopia promised, accept tradeoffs |
| **Capital as Medium** | Capital must circulate to regenerate (Article VII); markets as bounded tools (Article VI) |
| **Axioms** | Grounded in affirmation of existence; anti-hardening clause protects the axioms from dogmatism |

## What This Adds Beyond Core

1. **Physical/thermodynamic constraints** as hard limits on politics (Article I)
2. **Explicit system design principles**: negative feedback, damping, enforced boundaries (Article II)
3. **Markets as bounded information processors**, not moral authorities (Article VI)
4. **Capital circulation dynamics**: accumulation without regeneration = failure (Article VII)
5. **Anti-corruption clause**: explicit prohibition on metaphysical enemies, utopia promises, tradeoff denial (Article XI)
6. **Provisionality as principle**: all systems must permit their own revision (Article X)

## Status

This artifact synthesizes the core into political implications. It is a reference document—a constitutional frame for evaluating systems.
