# Songs

## Category Concept

This folder contains **musical expressions** of the philosophy — songs that embody the aesthetic and carry the ideas in sonic form.

Music bypasses argument. Where essays must convince, songs can simply present. The worldview enters through rhythm, melody, and production texture before the listener has decided whether to agree.

## What This Category Addresses

- How does the philosophy sound?
- What emotional experiences does it create?
- How can complex ideas be compressed into accessible form without dilution?
- What is the relationship between lyrical meaning and sonic texture?

## The Trojan Horse

A key concept for songs here is the **trojan horse** — using surface elegance to carry deeper strangeness. The listener is drawn in by beauty before sensing the alien core underneath.

This isn't deception. It's recognition that ideas which would be rejected as propositions can be accepted as experiences.
