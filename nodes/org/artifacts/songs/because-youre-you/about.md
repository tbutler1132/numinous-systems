# Because You're You

## Artifact Concept

A song about the power of deep connection. When someone truly matters to you, they have the power to evoke your strongest emotions — love or hate, but never indifference.

The opposite of love isn't hate; it's not thinking about someone at all. This song explores what it means when someone becomes significant enough that you can only feel intensely about them.

## Status

In progress.
