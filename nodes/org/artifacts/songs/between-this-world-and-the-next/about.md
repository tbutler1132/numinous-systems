# Between This World and the Next

## Artifact Concept

One of the most experimental tracks. Started as a rework of Kanye's "24" — an optimistic gospel song recontextualized over a haunting instrumental. The same lyrics completely flip in meaning, framing faith and religion as desperate existential dread rather than hope.

A study in how context transforms content. The liminal space between belief and terror.

## Status

In progress.
