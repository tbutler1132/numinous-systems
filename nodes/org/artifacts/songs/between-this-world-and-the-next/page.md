  # Between This World and the Next
  
  ## Artifact Concept
  
  One of the most experimental tracks. Started as a rework of Kanye's "24" — an optimistic gospel song recontextualized over a haunting instrumental. The same lyrics completely flip in meaning, framing faith and religion as desperate existential dread rather than hope.
  
  A study in how context transforms content. The liminal space between belief and terror.
  
  ## Status
  
  In progress.
