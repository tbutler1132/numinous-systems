# Bury The Sun

## Artifact Concept

A haunting track built around a vocal sample that sounds like "Bury the Sun." Similar existential territory to "Between This World and the Next" — dark, atmospheric, descending into shadow.

The image of burying the sun evokes extinguishing light, embracing darkness, the approach to something profound and terrifying.

## Status

In progress.
