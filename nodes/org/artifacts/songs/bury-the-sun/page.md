  # Bury The Sun
  
  ## Artifact Concept
  
  A haunting track built around a vocal sample that sounds like "Bury the Sun." Similar existential territory to "Between This World and the Next" — dark, atmospheric, descending into shadow.
  
  The image of burying the sun evokes extinguishing light, embracing darkness, the approach to something profound and terrifying.
  
  ## Status
  
  In progress.
