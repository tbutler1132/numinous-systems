# Coldness

## Artifact Concept

An emotional, sparse melody that sounds lonely and cold — then drops halfway through into a frenetic, vocal-ish synth. The structure mirrors emotional numbness cracking open.

The first half embodies isolation and distance; the second half is the breakdown, the crisis, what happens when you can't stay frozen anymore.

## Status

In progress.
