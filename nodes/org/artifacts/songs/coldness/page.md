  # Coldness
  
  ## Artifact Concept
  
  An emotional, sparse melody that sounds lonely and cold — then drops halfway through into a frenetic, vocal-ish synth. The structure mirrors emotional numbness cracking open.
  
  The first half embodies isolation and distance; the second half is the breakdown, the crisis, what happens when you can't stay frozen anymore.
  
  ## Status
  
  In progress.
