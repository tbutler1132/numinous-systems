  # Envy
  
  ## Artifact Concept
  
  An intro/invocation of the muse type track. Evokes foundational myths — Cain and Abel, Romulus and Remus. The jealousy between brothers, the violence at the beginning of things.
  
  Has the quality of setting the stage, opening an epic. Could function as an album intro.
  
  ## Status
  
  In progress.
