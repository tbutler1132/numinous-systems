# Won't You Lie To Me

Working notes and history.

## Concept

Everything in life is a lie — not nihilistically, but as observation. The "human" is a story. What we call identity, meaning, purpose — these are narratives, not facts. Underneath it's all just forces. Modernity, commercialism, consumerism, media — all of it is a kind of lie serving a larger trajectory, shepherding us toward some post-human phase. The song addresses this poetically, not didactically.

The hook lines should all be 5 syllables (matching "Won't you lie to me").

Open question: what is the emotional framing of "won't you lie to me"?
- **The lie as beautiful**: the narrative is what enables beauty, meaning, connection. Without the story there's just forces. The lie is a gift.
- **The lie as cowardice**: wanting comfort over truth. Choosing the story because reality is too much.
- **The lie as revelation**: this is what society actually wants. A mirror held up — everyone prefers the comfortable narrative.
- These framings may coexist or shift across the song.

## Structure

Intro -> Hook -> Verse -> Hook -> Bridge -> Outro

- Make "Won't You Lie to Me" part the hook. Use current melody I have for the verses. Remove won't you lie to me part. I can bump up the call response in the hook if I want. Make the current Synth build thingy a bridge into outro.
- Add Cello to outro?
