# Ordinary World

## Stage 1 of the Hero's Journey

The hero exists in their **normal life** — the world before transformation. This establishes the baseline: who the hero is, what they value, what's missing or incomplete.

The Ordinary World is not necessarily comfortable. It may be stagnant, unfulfilling, or quietly desperate. But it is *known*.

## Musical Character

Songs that fit this stage might embody:
- **Restlessness** — something is off, even if unnamed
- **Routine** — the texture of everyday existence
- **Longing** — a sense that there must be more
- **Stillness before the storm** — calm that precedes disruption

## Candidate Songs

*To be determined through listening and mapping.*

## Notes

(Working observations about which songs might fit here)
