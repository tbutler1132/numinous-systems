  # Ordinary World
  
  ## Stage 1 of the Hero's Journey
  
  The hero exists in their **normal life** — the world before transformation. This establishes the baseline: who the hero is, what they value, what's missing or incomplete.
  
  The Ordinary World is not necessarily comfortable. It may be stagnant, unfulfilling, or quietly desperate. But it is *known*.
  
  ## Musical Character
  
  Songs that fit this stage might embody:
  - **Restlessness** — something is off, even if unnamed
  - **Routine** — the texture of everyday existence
  - **Longing** — a sense that there must be more
  - **Stillness before the storm** — calm that precedes disruption
  
  ## Candidate Songs
  
  *To be determined through listening and mapping.*
  
  ## Notes
  
  (Working observations about which songs might fit here)
