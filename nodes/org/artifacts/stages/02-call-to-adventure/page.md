  # Call to Adventure
  
  ## Stage 2 of the Hero's Journey
  
  Something **disrupts** the ordinary world. A challenge appears, an invitation arrives, a crisis demands response. The hero is called to leave what they know.
  
  The call may be external (an event, a person, a message) or internal (a realization, a dream, a growing dissatisfaction that can no longer be ignored).
  
  ## Musical Character
  
  Songs that fit this stage might embody:
  - **Disruption** — the moment everything changes
  - **Urgency** — something demands attention
  - **Excitement** — the thrill of possibility
  - **Fear** — the weight of what's being asked
  
  ## Candidate Songs
  
  *To be determined through listening and mapping.*
  
  ## Notes
  
  (Working observations about which songs might fit here)
