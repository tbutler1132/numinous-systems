  # Meeting the Mentor
  
  ## Stage 4 of the Hero's Journey
  
  The hero encounters a **guide** — someone who has walked this path before, who offers wisdom, training, tools, or simply the encouragement to proceed.
  
  The mentor doesn't take the journey for the hero. They prepare the hero to take it themselves. Sometimes the mentor is a person; sometimes it's a book, a memory, an inner voice.
  
  ## Musical Character
  
  Songs that fit this stage might embody:
  - **Guidance** — receiving wisdom or direction
  - **Preparation** — gathering strength for what's ahead
  - **Trust** — learning to rely on something beyond yourself
  - **Transmission** — knowledge passing between generations
  
  ## Candidate Songs
  
  *To be determined through listening and mapping.*
  
  ## Notes
  
  (Working observations about which songs might fit here)
