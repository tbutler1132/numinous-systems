  # Crossing the Threshold
  
  ## Stage 5 of the Hero's Journey
  
  The hero **commits**. They leave the Ordinary World and enter the unknown. There is no going back — or rather, going back would mean a different kind of death.
  
  This is the point of no return. The threshold guardian is faced, the boundary is crossed, the adventure truly begins.
  
  ## Musical Character
  
  Songs that fit this stage might embody:
  - **Commitment** — the decision is made
  - **Departure** — leaving the known behind
  - **Courage** — moving forward despite fear
  - **Irreversibility** — something has fundamentally changed
  
  ## Candidate Songs
  
  *To be determined through listening and mapping.*
  
  ## Notes
  
  (Working observations about which songs might fit here)
