  # Approach to the Inmost Cave
  
  ## Stage 7 of the Hero's Journey
  
  The hero **prepares** for the central ordeal. They approach the most dangerous place — the lair of the dragon, the heart of enemy territory, the source of deepest fear.
  
  This is the pause before the plunge. Final preparations are made. The stakes become clear. There may be a moment of doubt, a last temptation to turn back.
  
  ## Musical Character
  
  Songs that fit this stage might embody:
  - **Anticipation** — knowing what's coming
  - **Tension** — the calm before the storm
  - **Focus** — gathering everything for what's ahead
  - **Vulnerability** — approaching what could destroy you
  
  ## Candidate Songs
  
  *To be determined through listening and mapping.*
