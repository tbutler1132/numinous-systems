# Reward

## Stage 9 of the Hero's Journey

The hero **seizes the sword**. Having survived the ordeal, they claim what they came for — the treasure, the elixir, the knowledge, the power.

This is the moment of triumph after the darkness. But the journey is not over. The reward must be brought back; transformation must be integrated.

## Musical Character

Songs that fit this stage might embody:
- **Triumph** — having survived the worst
- **Claiming** — taking what was earned
- **Relief** — the immediate aftermath of crisis
- **New power** — feeling the change within

## Candidate Songs

*To be determined through listening and mapping.*
