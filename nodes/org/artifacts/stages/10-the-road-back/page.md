  # The Road Back
  
  ## Stage 10 of the Hero's Journey
  
  The hero begins the **return**. They must bring the reward back to the Ordinary World, but the journey home has its own dangers. Enemies may pursue. The special world doesn't release its visitors easily.
  
  There's often a chase, a deadline, a final burst of urgency. The hero must commit to returning just as they committed to leaving.
  
  ## Musical Character
  
  Songs that fit this stage might embody:
  - **Urgency** — the race to return
  - **Pursuit** — being chased by what was left behind
  - **Determination** — pressing forward despite exhaustion
  - **Momentum** — the drive toward completion
  
  ## Candidate Songs
  
  *To be determined through listening and mapping.*
  
  ## Notes
  
  (Working observations about which songs might fit here)
