  # Return with the Elixir
  
  ## Stage 12 of the Hero's Journey
  
  The hero **returns home**, but transformed. They bring back the elixir — the treasure, wisdom, or power that can heal the Ordinary World or at least transform the hero's place within it.
  
  This is resolution. The journey is complete. What was learned is shared. The hero may become a mentor to others who will face their own calls.
  
  ## Musical Character
  
  Songs that fit this stage might embody:
  - **Completion** — the journey is over
  - **Wisdom** — knowing what wasn't known before
  - **Gift** — having something to offer
  - **Peace** — arriving somewhere new that is also home
  
  ## Candidate Songs
  
  *To be determined through listening and mapping.*
  
  ## Notes
  
  (Working observations about which songs might fit here)
