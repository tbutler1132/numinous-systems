# Stages

The 12 stages of the Hero's Journey, each a standalone artifact that composes a story fragment with candidate songs.

Stages are peers to songs, story fragments, and albums — not children of any of them. An album references stages in sequence. Each stage references a story fragment and song candidates. The stage is where narrative and music meet.

## Current Stages
