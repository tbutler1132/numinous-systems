# Story

## Category Concept

This folder contains artifacts of **personal mythos** — narrative explorations of lived experience rendered through the lens of mythology, fiction, and symbolic meaning.

These are not journals or factual accounts. They are the personal story told as if it were a myth worth telling — the arc, the themes, the transformations, the figures. The raw material is biographical; the form is literary.

## What This Category Addresses

- How does one make meaning of a life while living it?
- What patterns emerge when personal history is viewed through archetypal structures?
- How can fictionalization reveal truths that direct telling obscures?
- What is the relationship between the person living the life and the character in the story?

## Why Mythologize

Plain autobiography is trapped in justification and self-presentation. It must defend, explain, contextualize. It is written for imagined judges.

Mythos frees the material. Characters can fail spectacularly. Arcs can be tragic without apology. Symbols can carry meaning that resists articulation. The distance between author and protagonist creates space for honesty that memoir prohibits.

This is not escapism — it's a different kind of seeing.

## Connection to Broader Project

- **Beauty Redeems**: The mythologized life becomes a search for redemptive moments — where was beauty found? where was it missed?
- **Love of Fate**: To tell one's life as myth is to embrace it fully — the failures, the accidents, the strange turns become necessary plot rather than regrettable contingency
- **The Living System**: The hybrid subject is also a storied subject — we are always already narrating ourselves

## Relationship to Other Categories

Stories here draw from the same experiential ground as essays and songs but operate in a different register. An essay argues. A song condenses. A story unfolds.

What appears as analysis in essays or emotion in songs may first surface as narrative here — characters in situations, choices made, consequences lived.

## Status

This category is nascent. No artifacts yet exist here. The folder marks the intention to develop this form.
