  # Before the Hierarchy
  
  ## Artifact Concept
  
  The first story fragment. Childhood as the last moment of unmarked existence — before the social hierarchy reveals itself, before you know you are being sorted.
  
  Corresponds to Stage 1 (Ordinary World) of the Hero's Journey.
  
  ## Status
  
  Draft.

Childhood as the last moment of unmarked existence. You do not yet know you are being sorted.
