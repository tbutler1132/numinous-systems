# The Crucible

## Artifact Concept

High school as the social order's announcement through cruelty. Status determined by appearance, appearance determined by genetics you didn't choose. The hierarchy makes itself visible.

Corresponds to Stage 2 (Call to Adventure) of the Hero's Journey.

## Status

Draft.
