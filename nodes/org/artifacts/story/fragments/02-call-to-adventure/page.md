  ## Artifact Concept
  
  High school as the social order's announcement through cruelty. Status determined by appearance, appearance determined by genetics you didn't choose. The hierarchy makes itself visible.
  
  Corresponds to Stage 2 (Call to Adventure) of the Hero's Journey.
  
  ## Status
  
  Draft.

High school. The social order makes itself visible through cruelty. Status is determined by appearance, and appearance is determined by genetics you didn't choose. The ugly are marked. The spirit is systematically crushed by those who learned to crush it from those who crushed them.

You learn: the world is a competition you are losing. This is the call — not an invitation but a demand. The hierarchy has announced itself. You must find a way to survive it.
