# The False Path

## Artifact Concept

Business school as the false promise — optimize yourself into acceptability. The refusal disguised as compliance. Dreams corrupted by market logic before they're even dreamed.

Corresponds to Stage 3 (Refusal of the Call) of the Hero's Journey.

## Status

Draft.
