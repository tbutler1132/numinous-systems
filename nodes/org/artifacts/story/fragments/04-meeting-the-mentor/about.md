# The Glimpse

## Artifact Concept

The therapist as a glimpse of connection delivered through transaction. The mentor shows you what is possible, then disappears. The ambiguity of whether the warmth was real or performed is permanent.

Corresponds to Stage 4 (Meeting the Mentor) of the Hero's Journey.

## Status

Draft.
