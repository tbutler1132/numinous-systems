You start seeing a therapist. She is warm in a way that feels directed at you specifically. You talk for an hour each week. She listens. She reflects back what you say in ways that make you feel seen. For the first time, someone is paying attention — real attention, sustained attention — to the inside of your experience.

The mentor's function is not to give you tools that last forever. It is to show you what is possible. She demonstrates that connection *can* exist. That the isolation is not total. That somewhere, somehow, the walls can come down.

The connection is real. It is also a service you pay for. This is the modern condition: even the glimpse comes through a transaction.

Then it ends. Insurance changes. She moves practices. The reasons don't matter. What matters is the absence. You never learn if what you felt was the relationship itself or the professional performance of relationship — the therapeutic equivalent of a hologram designed to say exactly what you needed to hear until the session ended.

The question that haunts: was the warmth real, or was she performing her function? Maybe both. Maybe there is no difference anymore. You will never know. The ambiguity is permanent.

The loss is real even if you can't say what was lost. You know what you need now. And there is no non-transactional path to it.
