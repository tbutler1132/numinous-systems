Psych hospital. Discharge. You try to re-enter the world.

Shitty corporate job. Assistant media planner. Living with parents. Proving you can function.

You learn to code. You get a software job. You prove — to yourself, to the world — that you can adapt. You can succeed by conventional metrics. You can play the game.

But it is hollow. Soulless stability. Functional emptiness. You are surviving, not living.
