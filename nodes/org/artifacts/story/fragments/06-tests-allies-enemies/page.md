  # Survival
  
  ## Artifact Concept
  
  The slow work of proving you can exist at all. Psych ward, corporate jobs, learning to code. Surviving is not living, but it is the necessary precondition.
  
  Corresponds to Stage 6 (Tests, Allies, Enemies) of the Hero's Journey.
  
  ## Status
  
  Draft.
---

Psych hospital. Discharge. You try to re-enter the world.

Shitty corporate job. Assistant media planner. Living with parents. Proving you can function.

You learn to code. You get a software job. You prove — to yourself, to the world — that you can adapt. You can succeed by conventional metrics. You can play the game.

But it is hollow. Soulless stability. Functional emptiness. You are surviving, not living.
