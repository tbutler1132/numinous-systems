# The Hollow Victory

## Artifact Concept

Maximum isolation at peak conventional success. New York, alone, surrounded by eight million people, connected to none. The ladder was leaning against the wrong wall.

Corresponds to Stage 7 (Approach to the Inmost Cave) of the Hero's Journey.

## Status

Draft.
