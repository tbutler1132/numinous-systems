  ## Status
  
  Draft.

Move to New York. Live alone. Work remotely. You have achieved the modern dream: independence, professional success, freedom, the big city.

And you are more alone than you have ever been. Surrounded by eight million people, connected to none of them.

This is the approach. You have climbed to the top of the ladder and found it leaning against the wrong wall. Everything you were told to want — you have it. The emptiness is total.
