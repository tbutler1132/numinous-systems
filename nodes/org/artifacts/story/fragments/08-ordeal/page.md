You are watching football. Taylor Swift appears on screen. She is dating a football player. The camera cuts to her constantly. The crowd adores her. The world adores her.

Something breaks open.

Why does this bother you so much? Why does watching one person receive attention feel like an indictment of your entire existence?

The question will not let you go.

You begin to research. Late nights. Theory. Obscure PDFs and dead blogs. You are trying to understand the machine.

The realization comes slowly, then all at once:

This is not personal failure. This is structural. The system creates atomization. It produces isolation as a byproduct of its own operation. The loneliness is not a bug — it is a feature.

But you cannot fight it. Marxist resistance fails. The machine recuperates everything. And you cannot withdraw — you *are* modernity. You were made by it. To reject it completely would be self-negation.
