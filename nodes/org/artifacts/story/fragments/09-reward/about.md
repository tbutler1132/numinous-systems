# The Insight

## Artifact Concept

The realization that the boundary between self and system is not where you thought. Part human, part capitalism. The sword is not a weapon to defeat the machine but a lens to see it clearly.

Corresponds to Stage 9 (Reward) of the Hero's Journey.

## Status

Draft.
