  # The Insight
  
  ## Artifact Concept
  
  The realization that the boundary between self and system is not where you thought. Part human, part capitalism. The sword is not a weapon to defeat the machine but a lens to see it clearly.
  
  Corresponds to Stage 9 (Reward) of the Hero's Journey.
  
  ## Status
  
  Draft.

You are part human, part capitalism. The boundary between self and system is not where you thought it was. The machine is not outside you. It is inside you. It always has been.

This should be terrifying. Instead, it is clarifying.

This is the sword. Not a weapon to defeat the machine, but a lens to see it clearly. You cannot escape what you are made of. But you can *know* what you are made of. And in that knowing, something shifts.
