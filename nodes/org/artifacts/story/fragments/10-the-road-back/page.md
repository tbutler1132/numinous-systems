For a moment, you believe you are special. You have seen what others cannot see. Your suffering was not meaningless — it was the price of vision. You are the one who woke up.

Then the second realization, harder than the first: you are not the miracle child. Millions are suffering the same atomization, the same hollowness, the same slow drowning in systems they cannot name. Your insight is not unique. You are one of countless replicants who opened their eyes.

The road back is not triumphant. It is humbling. You are returning not as a chosen one but as one among many. The gift you carry may never be received. You will likely die in the snow with no one watching.
