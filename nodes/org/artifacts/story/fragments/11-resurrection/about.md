# The Choice

## Artifact Concept

The real test: do you build anyway, knowing you are not special, knowing the gift may never be received? Resurrection is not the return of the old self but the emergence of something new.

Corresponds to Stage 11 (Resurrection) of the Hero's Journey.

## Status

Draft.
