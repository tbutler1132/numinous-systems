This is the real test. Do you act anyway? Knowing you are not special, knowing the gift may never be received, knowing you will likely die in the snow with no one watching — do you still build?

The answer must be yes. Not because it will save you. Because it is the only meaningful act available.

This is the resurrection: not the return of the old self, but the emergence of something new. Someone who builds without needing an audience. Who creates without requiring validation. Who acts because acting is the only dignified response to seeing.
