# Story Fragments

The origin story broken into 12 fragments, one for each stage of Vogler's Hero's Journey.

Each fragment is a proper artifact with `about.md` (concept) and `page.md` (the narrative encounter). Fragments stand alone as pieces of writing and map to stages in Album 1.

The story and the album share the same structure. Each song on the album corresponds to a stage. Each stage corresponds to a fragment. The album is the sonic projection; the fragments are the narrative projection. Same arc, different interfaces.
