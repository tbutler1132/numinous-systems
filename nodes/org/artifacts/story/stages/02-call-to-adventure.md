# The Crucible

High school. The social order makes itself visible through cruelty. Status is determined by appearance, and appearance is determined by genetics you didn't choose. The ugly are marked. The spirit is systematically crushed by those who learned to crush it from those who crushed them.

You learn: the world is a competition you are losing. This is the call — not an invitation but a demand. The hierarchy has announced itself. You must find a way to survive it.

*This fragment corresponds to Stage 2 of the Hero's Journey: the call is not always a gift. Sometimes it is a wound that won't let you stay where you are.*
