# The False Path

Business school. The promised route to belonging. If you can't be beautiful, be successful. If you can't be loved, be rich. The logic is seductive: optimize yourself into acceptability.

But you can't do it. You commute instead of living there. You retreat into fantasies of music, of art, of another life — but even those dreams get corrupted. "What if I get famous? What if I get rich?" The market logic infects everything.

Later you will understand: the dreams were never yours. They were implanted. You thought you were refusing the system when you fantasized about art — but even those fantasies were market logic wearing a different mask. The desire to escape was itself manufactured by the thing you wanted to escape.

You go through the motions. You attend class. You do the work. But you are not there. You are somewhere else, waiting for something you cannot name.
