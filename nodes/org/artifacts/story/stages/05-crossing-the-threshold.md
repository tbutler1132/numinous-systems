# The Threshold

Graduation approaches. The fantasy cannot survive contact with reality. You will have to enter the world you've been avoiding. The relationship that proved connection was possible is gone. The future offers no path back to what you glimpsed.

March, senior year. The system tried to eliminate you — or you tried to eliminate yourself on its behalf. The distinction blurs. What is certain: you crossed into death and came back.

This is the threshold. Everything after is the return.

*This fragment corresponds to Stage 5 of the Hero's Journey: the threshold is not always a door you walk through. Sometimes it is a fall. Sometimes it is a death you survive.*
