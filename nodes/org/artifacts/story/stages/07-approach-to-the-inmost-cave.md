# The Hollow Victory

Move to New York. Live alone. Work remotely. You have achieved the modern dream: independence, professional success, freedom, the big city.

And you are more alone than you have ever been. Surrounded by eight million people, connected to none of them.

This is the approach. You have climbed to the top of the ladder and found it leaning against the wrong wall. Everything you were told to want — you have it. The emptiness is total.

*This fragment corresponds to Stage 7 of the Hero's Journey: the approach to the inmost cave is the moment you realize the treasure you were seeking was never in the place you were told to look.*
