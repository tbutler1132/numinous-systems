# The Insight

You are part human, part capitalism. The boundary between self and system is not where you thought it was. The machine is not outside you. It is inside you. It always has been.

This should be terrifying. Instead, it is clarifying.

This is the sword. Not a weapon to defeat the machine, but a lens to see it clearly. You cannot escape what you are made of. But you can *know* what you are made of. And in that knowing, something shifts.

*This fragment corresponds to Stage 9 of the Hero's Journey: the reward is not always treasure. Sometimes it is sight. Sometimes the sword is just the ability to see what was always there.*
