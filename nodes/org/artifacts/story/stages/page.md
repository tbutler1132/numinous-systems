  # Story Stages
  
  This folder contains the **origin story** broken into 12 fragments, one for each stage of Vogler's Hero's Journey.
  
  Each fragment:
  - Stands alone as a piece of writing
  - Maps to a stage in Album 1
  - Draws from the fictionalized/dramatized arc in `../notes.md`

  ## Connection to Album 1
  
  Each album stage (`nodes/org/artifacts/albums/album-1/XX-stage-name/about.md`) has a `story_fragment` field in its frontmatter that references the corresponding file here.
  
  The story provides the emotional/thematic content; the album provides the sonic embodiment. Same arc, different interfaces.
