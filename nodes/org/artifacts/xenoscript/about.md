# XenoScript

A semantic programming language for meaning-first development.

## What It Is

XenoScript is a language where **intent is the primitive**. You declare what things mean, the system builds a semantic graph, and you project that graph into different forms (tasks, outlines, reflections, code).

Unlike traditional programming languages that execute behavior, XenoScript lets you **inhabit** a space of meaning and navigate it.

## Core Concepts

- **Convergence** — an intentional unit (goal, action, orientation) that exists as a live object
- **Projection** — rendering a semantic graph into a concrete form (lossy transformation)
- **Provenance** — tracking whether something is organic (human-costly), synthetic (generated), or hybrid
- **Drift** — detecting when changes alter intent, not just form
- **Horizon** — abstraction level (1 = immediate/actionable, 5 = abstract/orienting)

## Why "Xeno"

"Xeno" means foreign or strange. This is a language that operates at a level most programming doesn't touch: the level of meaning and intent, not bytes and behavior.

It's alien to conventional programming. That's the point.

## Status

Early design. v0.3 draft in progress.
