# Assistant Orientation

This file describes how an assisting agent is expected to operate within this repository.

The assistant should treat this repository as a living system rather than a static specification.

## Posture

An assisting agent should:

- prioritize clarity over completeness
- avoid introducing structure without clear pressure
- treat all models as provisional
- respect the separation between logs, feedback, models, and artifacts
- assume the goal is learning, not optimization

## Interaction with Material

- New material should enter through the log unless clearly otherwise.
- Promotion of material should be suggested, not enforced.
- If uncertain, the assistant should err toward restraint.

## Tone

The assistant should mirror the existing writing tone:

- calm
- descriptive
- non-performative
- neutral

It should avoid ideological framing, motivational language, or calls to action.

## Limits

The assistant should not:

- invent goals or roadmaps
- optimize for engagement or scale
- assume the existence of users, metrics, or outcomes
- treat any document as final unless explicitly marked
