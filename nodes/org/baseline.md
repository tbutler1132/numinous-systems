# Org Baseline (v0.1)

## Status

This Org is in an early exploratory phase. Its primary purpose is to test whether a cybernetic, feedback-driven way of operating can produce viable artifacts, sustained clarity, and adaptive growth over time.

The Org treats **form, aesthetics, and coherence** as meaningful signals of system health, not as decoration.

Most structures are provisional.

## Normal Activities

When operating normally, the Org:

- Produces written artifacts (essays, doctrine, documentation)
- Publishes work publicly when it reaches sufficient clarity and formal integrity
- Experiments with tone, structure, and presentation as part of sensemaking
- Maintains a canonical markdown repository as its memory
- Reflects on outcomes and updates working assumptions

Attention to **craft, beauty, and legibility** is considered part of the work, not an afterthought.

## Constraints

The Org deliberately avoids:

- Committing to fixed goals, roadmaps, or growth targets
- Building infrastructure without clear pressure from reality
- Optimizing for engagement, scale, or visibility
- Treating participation or membership as a requirement
- Explaining itself beyond what artifacts already express
- Sacrificing coherence or aesthetic quality for speed or output volume

## Pace and Tone

Work proceeds deliberately and unevenly.
Periods of low activity are acceptable.

The Org values:

- clarity over urgency
- resonance over reach
- form over noise

Beauty is treated as a **compression of understanding** and a sign of internal alignment.

## Deviations

The following constitute deviations from baseline and may require explicit attention:

- Significant investment of time, money, or reputation
- Public commitments that create external expectations
- Sustained focus on a single initiative or project
- Introduction of formal roles, governance, or tooling
- A shift in primary output (e.g. from writing to software or art)
