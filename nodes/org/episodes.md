Timeboxed containers for action. Each episode is a hypothesis about how to orient.

This file is itself an experiment — testing whether the Episode concept is useful.

## Episode 01: Constraint Removal — Social Friction

**Timeframe:** Jan 20 – Jan 26, 2026

### Diagnosis

The current bottleneck is not ideas, skill, or effort. It is:

> **High cost of human contact, especially under ambiguity.**

This sits at the primary feedback channel (other humans), which means it slows everything downstream: business, collaboration, dating, momentum, confidence, decision-making, sense of forward motion.

As long as this channel is expensive, the system compensates with internal simulation instead of action and feedback.

### Hypothesis

Reducing social friction is the highest-leverage intervention right now. This is constraint removal, not self-improvement.

Working directly on business or projects routes through the same bottleneck — effort increases without throughput. Reducing friction:
- shortens action → feedback loops
- collapses uncertainty faster
- makes business and collaboration executable
- lowers emotional cost per action

### What I Am Training

Not trying to: become outgoing, like parties, be charismatic, enjoy socializing, change personality.

Training:
- cheap initiation
- tolerance of ambiguity
- fast recovery
- low-cost follow-up
- repeated exposure to neutral outcomes

Low-noise, repeatable environments (cafés, gyms, coworking) beat high-stimulation events early on.

### What I Am Measuring

Cost, not performance. Three proxies tracked coarsely (daily or weekly):

| Proxy | What it means |
|-------|---------------|
| Initiation latency | How long from "I should do this" → doing it |
| Recovery time | How long interactions occupy my mind after |
| Follow-up resistance | How costly it feels to re-engage |

Not tracking: outcomes, validation, success, how "well" things went.

### Decision Rule

> **Did social friction change what I chose to do this week?**

If yes → still the bottleneck, continue.  
If no (consistently) → it isn't, move on.

### Focus Areas
- Initiate at least one interaction per day
- Physical presence in low-noise social spaces
- Say yes to invitations that feel mildly uncomfortable but reversible
- Act small and reversible when unsure

### Actions

**Baseline (must-do):**
- [ ] Coworking 2x this week
- [ ] One initiation per day (any context)

**Stretch (optional):**
- [ ] Attend one event or gathering
- [ ] Start conversation with stranger
- [ ] Reach out to one person for coffee/drinks
- [ ] Reach out to 1-2 people for informational interview (creative director / brand space)

### Log

| Date | Initiation | Recovery | Follow-up | Notes (1 sentence max) |
|------|------------|----------|-----------|------------------------|
| | immediate / same day / avoided | minutes / hours / next day | none / some / avoided | |
