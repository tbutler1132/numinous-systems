Timeboxed containers for action. Each episode is a hypothesis about how to orient.

This file is itself an experiment — testing whether the Episode concept is useful.

## Episode 01: Constraint Removal — Social Friction

**Timeframe:** Jan 20 – Jan 26, 2026

### Diagnosis

The bottleneck is not ideas, skill, or effort. It is:

> **High cost of human contact, especially under ambiguity.**

This blocks the primary feedback channel (other humans), which slows everything downstream: business, collaboration, dating, momentum, decision-making.

The system compensates with internal simulation instead of action and feedback. "Maybe it'll resolve itself" is a symptom.

### Hypothesis

Reducing social friction is the highest-leverage intervention. Constraint removal, not self-improvement.

Working on projects routes through the same bottleneck — effort increases without throughput. Reducing friction:
- shortens action → feedback loops
- collapses uncertainty faster
- makes business and collaboration executable

### What I Am Training

**Not:** become outgoing, like parties, be charismatic, enjoy socializing, change personality.

**Training:**
- cheap initiation (low startup cost)
- tolerance of ambiguity (act before certainty)
- fast recovery (let go quickly)
- low-cost follow-up (re-engage without drama)

Low-noise, repeatable environments (cafés, gyms, coworking) beat high-stimulation events.

### Friction Inventory

Where friction actually shows up (update as patterns emerge):

| Context | Stakes | Friction pattern |
|---------|--------|------------------|
| Work — flagging issues | medium | "He'll probably handle it" / wait and hope |
| Reaching out to acquaintances | medium | Delay until it feels "justified" |
| Strangers online | low | Minimal — easy to do |
| In-person strangers | medium | ? |
| Asking for help / favors | high | ? |
| Ambiguous social situations | high | ? |

### What I Am Measuring

**Cost, not performance.** You can't fail an interaction — you just get data.

| Metric | What it means | Scale |
|--------|---------------|-------|
| Initiation | Time from "I should" → doing it | immediate / same day / avoided |
| Recovery | How long it occupies your mind after | minutes / hours / next day |
| Follow-up | How costly re-engaging feels | easy / some resistance / avoided |

**Not tracking:** outcomes, validation, success, how "well" it went.

### Decision Rule

> **Did social friction change what I chose to do this week?**

If yes → still the bottleneck, continue.
If no (consistently) → move on.

### Avoidance Patterns to Watch

- "They'll probably handle it" → waiting instead of reaching out
- "I'll do it when I have something good to say" → waiting for perfect moment
- "It's not a big deal" → minimizing to justify inaction
- Checking if someone else will go first
- Rehearsing what to say instead of saying it

### Actions

**Baseline (non-negotiable):**
- [ ] Coworking 2x this week
- [ ] One initiation per day (any stakes level)

**Stretch (pick any):**
- [ ] Attend one event or gathering
- [ ] In-person conversation with stranger
- [ ] Reach out to someone for coffee/drinks
- [ ] Informational interview outreach (creative director / brand space)
- [ ] Flag something at work within 5 minutes of noticing it

### Log

| Date | Stakes | Initiation | Recovery | Follow-up | Notes |
|------|--------|------------|----------|-----------|-------|
| Jan 20 | low | immediate | minutes | — | Twitter reply to stranger; made account non-anonymous |
| Jan 20 | med | avoided | — | — | Work: noticed broken interface, hesitated to flag it |
| | low/med/high | immediate / same day / avoided | min / hrs / day | easy / some / avoided | |
| | | | | | |
