# Feedback

This file records signals from reality that should not be ignored.

Feedback is recorded when:

- an action produces an unexpected result
- friction repeats
- constraints assert themselves
- responses from others clarify or distort intent
- something clearly works or clearly does not

Entries should be factual and minimal.
Interpretation belongs elsewhere.

Not all experiences are feedback.
Only signals that affect future behavior are recorded here.
