# Feedback

This file records signals from reality that should not be ignored.

Feedback is recorded when:

- an action produces an unexpected result
- friction repeats
- constraints assert themselves
- responses from others clarify or distort intent
- something clearly works or clearly does not

Entries should be factual and minimal.
Interpretation belongs elsewhere.

Not all experiences are feedback.
Only signals that affect future behavior are recorded here.

- Notes feel a little messy...
- I like the idea of having Episodes

- Not directly on an artifact, but I saw a popular post on X expressing an intense disdain for AI generated/assissted long form writing. This user has no social standing that would make me value their opinion highly, but I have admit there was a certain sense of agreement on my end. The piece they were referring to was quite offputting to me. The writer of the piece claimed it was not in fact AI generated, so perhaps that made it even more unappealing (the piece itself was about basically using AI for everything). My reaction to this did make me reconsider how to inject more human into more work. The thing is that is kind of the point of this whole experiment, and I would say the "humanity" starts at the root. Social media is already a mediated machinic environment, posting on this sight bemoaning AI is a bit absurd. Therefore I don't know how much I should really take from that- only worry about such responses as it relates to the ends. Only thing I could look at is my own comfort level regarding the outputs
