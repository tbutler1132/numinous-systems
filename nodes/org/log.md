# Log

This file is a chronological record of what actually happens.

It is the primary writing surface for the Org.
Entries may include actions taken, observations, tensions, surprises, unfinished thoughts, or anything that feels relevant in the moment.

This log is not curated and not optimized for clarity.
Messiness is acceptable.

If something feels important but unclear, it belongs here first.

Some entries may later be extracted into:

- feedback (when reality pushes back)
- models (when patterns stabilize)
- artifacts (when something endures)

Nothing is required to leave the log.

## 2026-01-08

- Contemplating best way to begin external feedback loops
- If the first artifact is published, how should it be amplified?
- No obvious audience for this work; constraint noted
- First draft of Vital Systems essay written; revised for sentence rhythm
- Updated Writing Tone model: sentence length should vary for rhythm
- Think that I should do some video logs to create a more personal effect
  - Maybe do a couple practice ones first before publishing
