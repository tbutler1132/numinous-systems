# Log

This file is a chronological record of what actually happens.

It is the primary writing surface for the Org.
Entries may include actions taken, observations, tensions, surprises, unfinished thoughts, or anything that feels relevant in the moment.

This log is not curated and not optimized for clarity.
Messiness is acceptable.

If something feels important but unclear, it belongs here first.

Some entries may later be extracted into:

- feedback (when reality pushes back)
- models (when patterns stabilize)
- artifacts (when something endures)

Nothing is required to leave the log.

- Deleted Vital Systems v1 essay. Not close to quality standard quite frankly.
- Didn't remove writing tone model, but made its status "low". Reason is I am thinking it may be better to just write some pieces and have those for reference, rather than trying to force writing style. On the other hand it is sort of a "meta" part of the experiment so may not want to delete it completely
  - Pros:
    - Embraces AI as a sort of "artistic" medium by pushing in: Instead of just asking to write, defining the tone, iterating on prompting, etc
    - The repository + agents _is_ the medium
    - Can apply the same level of effort just "higher up the stack"
  - Cons:
    - Can be immediately noticeable and disqualifying in some ways
  - Either way, it would require some sort of external "human" voice, whether that be purely verbal, or through music.

## 2026-01-08

- Contemplating best way to begin external feedback loops
- If the first artifact is published, how should it be amplified?
- No obvious audience for this work; constraint noted
- First draft of Vital Systems essay written; revised for sentence rhythm
- Updated Writing Tone model: sentence length should vary for rhythm
- Think that I should do some video logs to create a more personal effect
  - Maybe do a couple practice ones first before publishing
