# Log

This file is a chronological record of what actually happens.

It is the primary writing surface for the Org.
Entries may include actions taken, observations, tensions, surprises, unfinished thoughts, or anything that feels relevant in the moment.

This log is not curated and not optimized for clarity.
Messiness is acceptable.

If something feels important but unclear, it belongs here first.

Some entries may later be extracted into:

- feedback (when reality pushes back)
- models (when patterns stabilize)
- artifacts (when something endures)

Nothing is required to leave the log.
