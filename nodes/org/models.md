# Models

This file contains the working models that currently guide action.

Models describe what the Org is acting _as if_ is true.
They may include assumptions, emerging patterns, constraints, or learned rules.

Each model should indicate:

- its status (assumption, emerging, learned)
- why it is being used
- what might revise or falsify it

Models are provisional.
They are revised or discarded when feedback demands it.

This file represents the Org’s current understanding, not doctrine.
