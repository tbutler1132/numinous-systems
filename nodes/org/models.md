# Models

This file contains the working models that currently guide action.

Models describe what the Org is acting _as if_ is true.
They may include assumptions, emerging patterns, constraints, or learned rules.

Each model should indicate:

- its status (assumption, emerging, learned)
- why it is being used
- what might revise or falsify it

Models are provisional.
They are revised or discarded when feedback demands it.

This file represents the Org's current understanding, not doctrine.

## Operational Baseline

### Status: Exploratory

This model describes the Org's current operational state, normal activities, constraints, and pace.

The Org is in an early exploratory phase. Its primary purpose is to test whether a cybernetic, feedback-driven way of operating can produce viable artifacts, sustained clarity, and adaptive growth over time.

The Org treats **form, aesthetics, and coherence** as meaningful signals of system health, not as decoration.

Most structures are provisional.

### Normal Activities

When operating normally, the Org:

- Produces written artifacts (essays, doctrine, documentation)
- Publishes work publicly when it reaches sufficient clarity and formal integrity
- Experiments with tone, structure, and presentation as part of sensemaking
- Maintains a canonical markdown repository as its memory
- Reflects on outcomes and updates working assumptions

Attention to **craft, beauty, and legibility** is considered part of the work, not an afterthought.

### Constraints

The Org deliberately avoids:

- Committing to fixed goals, roadmaps, or growth targets
- Building infrastructure without clear pressure from reality
- Optimizing for engagement, scale, or visibility
- Treating participation or membership as a requirement
- Explaining itself beyond what artifacts already express
- Sacrificing coherence or aesthetic quality for speed or output volume

### Pace and Tone

Work proceeds deliberately and unevenly.
Periods of low activity are acceptable.

The Org values:

- clarity over urgency
- resonance over reach
- form over noise

Beauty is treated as a **compression of understanding** and a sign of internal alignment.

### Deviations

The following constitute deviations from baseline and may require explicit attention:

- Significant investment of time, money, or reputation
- Public commitments that create external expectations
- Sustained focus on a single initiative or project
- Introduction of formal roles, governance, or tooling
- A shift in primary output (e.g. from writing to software or art)

### Revision Signal

This model should be reconsidered if:

- the Org's purpose or phase changes significantly
- constraints begin to feel arbitrary rather than protective
- normal activities no longer produce the intended outcomes
- deviations become routine rather than exceptional

## Writing Tone

### Status: Low confidence

This model records the current writing posture of the Org.
It reflects learned constraints rather than aspirational style.

It may change if it stops producing clarity or coherence over time.

### Orientation

Writing aims to be:

- descriptive rather than prescriptive
- calm rather than urgent
- precise rather than expressive
- restrained rather than persuasive

Texts should orient the reader within a larger context rather than argue toward a conclusion.

The tone assumes that forces larger than any single author or moment are already at work.

### Language Choices

Prefer:

- varied sentence rhythm; short sentences for emphasis, longer sentences for flow
- concrete terms
- neutral framing
- statements that describe conditions rather than intentions

Avoid:

- moral language
- ideological signaling
- motivational framing
- rhetorical flourish
- em dashes

Language should feel steady and grounded.
When in doubt, reduce intensity.

### Posture Toward the Reader

The reader is assumed to be intelligent and autonomous.

Writing should not:

- instruct the reader what to believe
- imply ethical superiority
- anticipate agreement
- apologize for incompleteness

The text does not seek followers, alignment, or momentum.
It exists to be encountered.

### Use of Concepts

Concepts are introduced only when needed.
They are named carefully and described plainly.

Concepts should feel discovered rather than declared.
If a concept cannot be stated without emphasis, it is likely premature.

### Sense of Scale

Writing should occasionally imply:

- continuity beyond the present moment
- systems that persist longer than individual decisions
- patterns that recur without being controlled

These implications should remain subtle.
They are background conditions, not themes.

### Revision Signal

This model should be reconsidered if:

- writing begins to feel performative
- explanation replaces observation
- persuasion replaces clarity
- symbolism overtakes usefulness

## Domain Management

### Status: Emerging

This model describes how the Org acquires and maintains domains.

### Protocol

- Use a single registrar for all domains (currently: Cloudflare)
- Enable auto-renew for any domain tied to identity or long-term projects
- Consolidate scattered domains to the primary registrar when practical
- Review domain list annually (January)

### Tracking

Active domains are tracked in [[entities/domains]].

### Revision Signal

Revise if:

- the registrar becomes unreliable or expensive
- domains are forgotten or expire unexpectedly
- the list exceeds what can be casually tracked

## Information Triage

### Status: Emerging

This model describes how material recorded in the system is informally differentiated over time.

It does not prescribe a workflow.
It supports recognition.

### Orientation

All material enters the system through the log.

Over time, some material proves to be:

- a transient observation
- a signal from reality
- a stabilized assumption
- a durable output

The purpose of this model is to notice that distinction when it becomes obvious.

### Differentiation

Material tends to move as follows:

- **Log**
  When something is happening but not yet understood.

- **Feedback**
  When an event or pattern clearly affects future behavior.

- **Models**
  When repeated feedback stabilizes into an assumption or constraint.

- **Artifacts**
  When something is worth preserving independently of context or process.

Movement is optional.
Nothing is required to leave the log.
