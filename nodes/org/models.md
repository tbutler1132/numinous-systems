# Models

This file contains the working [models](../ontology.md#model) that currently guide the Org's action.

Models describe what the Org is acting _as if_ is true. They are not claims about reality - they are useful compressions that shape behavior until feedback demands revision. This is a core cybernetic principle: systems regulate themselves through feedback, but need internal models to interpret that feedback and decide how to act.

## Status Levels

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| assumption | Untested belief the Org is committed to acting on. Revised when reality disproves. |
| emerging | Being validated through ongoing work. Some supporting evidence exists. |
| learned | Confirmed by repeated feedback. High confidence, but still revisable. |

## Model Categories

| Category | Description | Revised When |
|----------|-------------|--------------|
| Operational | How the Org works (processes, protocols, tone) | Process fails or becomes friction |
| Strategic | What the Org believes will work (hypotheses, bets about the world) | Reality disproves the hypothesis |

Strategic models (especially at Assumption status) are distinct from Episodes. Episodes are bounded experiments with clear start/end - good for testing operational changes. Strategic models are ongoing bets you're committed to acting on, revised through sustained contact with reality rather than discrete tests.

## Model Requirements

Each model should indicate:

- its status (assumption, emerging, learned)
- its category (operational or strategic)
- why it is being used
- when it was created or last revised
- what might revise or falsify it (revision signal)

Models are provisional.
They are revised or discarded when feedback demands it.

This file represents the Org's current understanding, not doctrine.

## Operational Baseline

### Status: Emerging | Category: Operational

**Created:** 2025-01  
**Last revised:** 2026-01

### Why

The Org needs a reference point for what "normal" looks like, so that deviations can be recognized and assessed deliberately rather than drifting into them.

### Description

This model describes the Org's current operational state, normal activities, constraints, and pace.

The Org is in an early exploratory phase. Its primary purpose is to test whether a cybernetic, feedback-driven way of operating can produce viable artifacts, sustained clarity, and adaptive growth over time.

The Org treats **form, aesthetics, and coherence** as meaningful signals of system health, not as decoration.

Most structures are provisional.

### Normal Activities

When operating normally, the Org:

- Produces written artifacts (essays, doctrine, documentation)
- Publishes work publicly when it reaches sufficient clarity and formal integrity
- Experiments with tone, structure, and presentation as part of sensemaking
- Maintains a canonical markdown repository as its memory
- Reflects on outcomes and updates working assumptions

Attention to **craft, beauty, and legibility** is considered part of the work, not an afterthought.

### Constraints

The Org deliberately avoids:

- Committing to fixed goals, roadmaps, or growth targets
- Building infrastructure without clear pressure from reality
- Optimizing for engagement, scale, or visibility
- Treating participation or membership as a requirement
- Explaining itself beyond what artifacts already express
- Sacrificing coherence or aesthetic quality for speed or output volume

### Pace and Tone

Work proceeds deliberately and unevenly.
Periods of low activity are acceptable.

The Org values:

- clarity over urgency
- resonance over reach
- form over noise

Beauty is treated as a **compression of understanding** and a sign of internal alignment.

### Deviations

The following constitute deviations from baseline and may require explicit attention:

- Significant investment of time, money, or reputation
- Public commitments that create external expectations
- Sustained focus on a single initiative or project
- Introduction of formal roles, governance, or tooling
- A shift in primary output (e.g. from writing to software or art)

### Revision Signal

This model should be reconsidered if:

- the Org's purpose or phase changes significantly
- constraints begin to feel arbitrary rather than protective
- normal activities no longer produce the intended outcomes
- deviations become routine rather than exceptional

## Writing Tone

### Status: Assumption | Category: Operational

**Created:** 2025-01  
**Last revised:** 2026-01

### Why

Writing is the Org's primary output medium. Having an explicit posture prevents drift toward generic or performative styles, and provides a reference point when tone feels off.

### Description

This model records the current writing posture of the Org.
It reflects learned constraints rather than aspirational style.

It may change if it stops producing clarity or coherence over time.

### Orientation

Writing aims to be:

- descriptive rather than prescriptive
- calm rather than urgent
- precise rather than expressive
- restrained rather than persuasive

Texts should orient the reader within a larger context rather than argue toward a conclusion.

The tone assumes that forces larger than any single author or moment are already at work.

### Language Choices

Prefer:

- varied sentence rhythm; short sentences for emphasis, longer sentences for flow
- concrete terms
- neutral framing
- statements that describe conditions rather than intentions

Avoid:

- moral language
- ideological signaling
- motivational framing
- rhetorical flourish
- em dashes

Language should feel steady and grounded.
When in doubt, reduce intensity.

### Posture Toward the Reader

The reader is assumed to be intelligent and autonomous.

Writing should not:

- instruct the reader what to believe
- imply ethical superiority
- anticipate agreement
- apologize for incompleteness

The text does not seek followers, alignment, or momentum.
It exists to be encountered.

### Use of Concepts

Concepts are introduced only when needed.
They are named carefully and described plainly.

Concepts should feel discovered rather than declared.
If a concept cannot be stated without emphasis, it is likely premature.

### Sense of Scale

Writing should occasionally imply:

- continuity beyond the present moment
- systems that persist longer than individual decisions
- patterns that recur without being controlled

These implications should remain subtle.
They are background conditions, not themes.

### Revision Signal

This model should be reconsidered if:

- writing begins to feel performative
- explanation replaces observation
- persuasion replaces clarity
- symbolism overtakes usefulness

## Domain Management

### Status: Learned | Category: Operational

**Created:** 2025-06  
**Last revised:** 2026-01

### Why

Domains are easy to acquire and easy to forget. Without a protocol, they scatter across registrars, expire unexpectedly, or accumulate without purpose.

### Protocol

- Use a single registrar for all domains (currently: Cloudflare)
- Enable auto-renew for any domain tied to identity or long-term projects
- Consolidate scattered domains to the primary registrar when practical
- Review domain list annually (January)

### Tracking

Active domains are tracked in [[entities/domains]].

### Revision Signal

Revise if:

- the registrar becomes unreliable or expensive
- domains are forgotten or expire unexpectedly
- the list exceeds what can be casually tracked

## Information Triage

### Status: Emerging | Category: Operational

**Created:** 2025-11  
**Last revised:** 2026-01

### Why

Material accumulates. Without a model for how things naturally differentiate, everything stays in the log indefinitely or gets promoted arbitrarily. This model supports recognition of what material has become.

### Relationship to Ontology

This model describes an internal flow within the Org. The primitives in [[ontology]] (Observation, Entity, Artifact) are universal concepts that apply across nodes. This model is about how material moves through *this* node's processing, using terms specific to the Org's workflow (log, feedback, models, artifacts). The two frameworks are complementary, not competing.

### Orientation

All material enters the system through the log.

Over time, some material proves to be:

- a transient observation
- a signal from reality
- a stabilized assumption
- a durable output

The purpose of this model is to notice that distinction when it becomes obvious.

### Differentiation

Material tends to move as follows:

- **Log**
  When something is happening but not yet understood.

- **Feedback**
  When an event or pattern clearly affects future behavior.

- **Models**
  When repeated feedback stabilizes into an assumption or constraint.

- **Artifacts**
  When something is worth preserving independently of context or process.

Movement is optional.
Nothing is required to leave the log.

### Revision Signal

Revise if:

- the flow described no longer matches how material actually moves
- distinctions feel forced rather than natural
- the model prescribes rather than describes

## Collaborative Work

### Status: Assumption | Category: Operational

**Created:** 2026-01  
**Last revised:** 2026-01

### Why

When multiple people work on the same creative output, ambiguity about ownership and integration kills momentum faster than disagreement does. Without explicit protocol, work stalls or fragments.

### Description

The Org follows [The Trunk Model](artifacts/practice/the-trunk-model/notes.md) for collaborative creative work.

Core commitments:

- There is always one canonical version (the trunk)
- Branches are short-lived and purpose-driven
- One person owns integration at any given time
- Integration is selective, not additive
- Forward motion over perfection

### Revision Signal

Revise if:

- the framework creates friction in actual collaboration
- integration ownership becomes contested or unclear
- branches routinely live too long or accumulate without resolution
- the model prescribes structure that reality does not demand

## Speculative Work

### Status: Assumption | Category: Strategic

**Created:** 2026-01  
**Last revised:** 2026-01

### Why

Not all work carries the same commitment. Some actions are reversible and low-cost; others create obligations, lock in structure, or foreclose options. Without this distinction, the Org either waits too long (missing easy wins) or moves too fast (creating premature lock-in).

### Description

This model distinguishes between work that can be done speculatively and work that should wait for pressure from reality.

**Low-commitment work** (safe to do early):
- Data ingestion and normalized storage
- Memory layer infrastructure
- Observation capture
- Reading, research, exploration

These create optionality without obligation. You cannot ask questions about data you do not have. Worst case: it sits unused. Best case: it is there when needed.

**High-commitment work** (wait for reality):
- Systems, processes, UIs
- Interpretations and recommendations
- Workflows and automations
- Public commitments

These encode assumptions and create expectations. They should emerge from pressure, not speculation.

The memory layer is infrastructure. Fill it early. Everything downstream should wait.

### Revision Signal

Revise if:

- ingested data creates unexpected lock-in or obligations
- waiting for pressure causes missed opportunities that were obvious in retrospect
- the distinction stops mapping to actual decision-making
