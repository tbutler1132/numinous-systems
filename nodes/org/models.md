# Models

This file contains the working models that currently guide action.

Models describe what the Org is acting _as if_ is true.
They may include assumptions, emerging patterns, constraints, or learned rules.

Each model should indicate:

- its status (assumption, emerging, learned)
- why it is being used
- what might revise or falsify it

Models are provisional.
They are revised or discarded when feedback demands it.

This file represents the Org’s current understanding, not doctrine.

## Writing Tone

### Status: Low confidence

This model records the current writing posture of the Org.
It reflects learned constraints rather than aspirational style.

It may change if it stops producing clarity or coherence over time.

### Orientation

Writing aims to be:

- descriptive rather than prescriptive
- calm rather than urgent
- precise rather than expressive
- restrained rather than persuasive

Texts should orient the reader within a larger context rather than argue toward a conclusion.

The tone assumes that forces larger than any single author or moment are already at work.

### Language Choices

Prefer:

- varied sentence rhythm; short sentences for emphasis, longer sentences for flow
- concrete terms
- neutral framing
- statements that describe conditions rather than intentions

Avoid:

- moral language
- ideological signaling
- motivational framing
- rhetorical flourish
- em dashes

Language should feel steady and grounded.
When in doubt, reduce intensity.

### Posture Toward the Reader

The reader is assumed to be intelligent and autonomous.

Writing should not:

- instruct the reader what to believe
- imply ethical superiority
- anticipate agreement
- apologize for incompleteness

The text does not seek followers, alignment, or momentum.
It exists to be encountered.

### Use of Concepts

Concepts are introduced only when needed.
They are named carefully and described plainly.

Concepts should feel discovered rather than declared.
If a concept cannot be stated without emphasis, it is likely premature.

### Sense of Scale

Writing should occasionally imply:

- continuity beyond the present moment
- systems that persist longer than individual decisions
- patterns that recur without being controlled

These implications should remain subtle.
They are background conditions, not themes.

### Revision Signal

This model should be reconsidered if:

- writing begins to feel performative
- explanation replaces observation
- persuasion replaces clarity
- symbolism overtakes usefulness

## Information Triage

### Status

This model describes how material recorded in the system is informally differentiated over time.

It does not prescribe a workflow.
It supports recognition.

### Orientation

All material enters the system through the log.

Over time, some material proves to be:

- a transient observation
- a signal from reality
- a stabilized assumption
- a durable output

The purpose of this model is to notice that distinction when it becomes obvious.

### Differentiation

Material tends to move as follows:

- **Log**
  When something is happening but not yet understood.

- **Feedback**
  When an event or pattern clearly affects future behavior.

- **Models**
  When repeated feedback stabilizes into an assumption or constraint.

- **Artifacts**
  When something is worth preserving independently of context or process.

Movement is optional.
Nothing is required to leave the log.
