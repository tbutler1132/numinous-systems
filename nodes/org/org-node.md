# Org Node

This directory represents the **Org Node**.

The Org Node is a public, durable entity responsible for:

- producing artifacts
- holding doctrine
- maintaining continuity over time

It is not a proxy for any individual.
Humans may operate this Node, but the Node persists beyond any one operator.

## Files

- [[models]]  
  Assumptions, patterns, and learned models that currently guide action.
  Includes the operational baseline describing what is normal for the Org.
  All models are provisional and revisable.

- [[episodes]]  
  Timeboxed containers for action. Each episode is a hypothesis about orientation.
  Experimental — testing whether this concept is useful.

## Operating principle

Actions are attributed to the Node whose trajectory they affect.

The Org Node learns from its own actions, feedback, and artifacts.
