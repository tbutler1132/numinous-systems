# Process

Experimental operational documents. These are loose, unstructured tests of whether a concept is useful for how the node works.

## Lifecycle

1. **Draft** — document created to test an idea
2. **Testing** — actively used, adjusted based on feedback
3. **Graduate** — concept proves useful, becomes official (moves to ontology or becomes automated)
4. **Abandon** — concept doesn't work, document archived or deleted

## Current Contents

- **models.md** — provisional beliefs guiding action (testing the Model concept from ontology)
- **episodes.md** — timeboxed containers for action (testing whether Episodes are useful)
- **retros.md** — weekly reflections (testing a reflection rhythm)

## Relationship to Ontology

Documents here may test concepts that already appear in the ontology (like Models) or explore new concepts that might eventually be added. Graduation means the concept has proven useful through sustained feedback.

These are not artifacts. They are operational infrastructure in draft form.
