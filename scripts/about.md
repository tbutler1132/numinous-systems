# About Scripts

Scripts are shortcuts for the hands.

## Why Scripts Exist

Some actions happen often enough that friction matters. Opening a file, typing a command, waiting—these small costs accumulate. Scripts reduce the distance between intention and action.

## What Lives Here

Shell utilities that integrate the system into daily workflow:

- **capture.sh** — Quick inbox capture from anywhere. A thought arrives; it goes to the inbox in one gesture.

## The Principle

A script earns its place by removing friction from something that happens regularly. If an action is rare, a script is overhead. If an action is frequent, a script is kindness to your future self.

Scripts are not automation for its own sake. They are paths worn smooth by use.
