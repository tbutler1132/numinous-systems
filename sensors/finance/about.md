# Finance Sensor

A memory organ for financial transactions.

## What It Is

The finance sensor converts bank exports into observations. It reads CSV files from Chase, normalizes the data, and stores transactions in the observation layer.

It does not analyze, judge, or recommend. Those are downstream concerns. The sensor's discipline is faithful perception: observe what happened, remember it, move on.

## Why It Exists

Money flows constantly. Without a sensor, that flow is invisible to the system. Statements pile up or get deleted. Patterns remain hidden.

The finance sensor makes financial activity legible to memory. Once observed, transactions can be queried, correlated, and understood over time.

## The Ritual

Download. Drop. Ingest. That's the habit being installed.

The regularity matters more than the analysis. Memory accumulates. Understanding follows.

## Technical Details

Built on [Sensor Core](../../core/sensor/about.md), the shared observation infrastructure.

See [README.md](README.md) for installation, CLI usage, and payload schema.
