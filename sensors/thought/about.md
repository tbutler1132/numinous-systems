# Thought Sensor

A bridge from fuzzy capture to durable memory.

## What It Is

The thought sensor processes inbox items into observations. It implements the legibility step in the progression: fuzzy, legible, encoded, enforced.

The inbox is fuzzy. The observation store is encoded. This tool is the controlled moment of legibility, where you decide what's worth remembering and how to categorize it.

## Why It Exists

Thoughts arrive constantly. Most disappear. The ones that get written down often stay in inboxes indefinitely, neither processed nor discarded.

The thought sensor creates a deliberate moment of triage. Each item is examined, tagged, and either committed to memory or released. Nothing lingers in ambiguity.

## The Ritual

Capture throughout the day. Process periodically. The inbox empties. Memory fills. The habit is the point.
