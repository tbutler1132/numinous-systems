# About XenoScript

XenoScript is a language for thinking about meaning.

## Why XenoScript Exists

Most programming languages treat meaning as an afterthought. You write code; meaning lives in comments, documentation, the programmer's head. The machine sees syntax. The human sees intent. They rarely meet.

XenoScript inverts this. Meaning is the primitive. You declare what something *is*—its semantic identity—and the system builds structure around that.

## What Makes It Different

**Provenance as first-class data.** Every node knows its origin. Was it typed by a human (organic) or generated by the system (synthetic)? This matters. Knowing what came from where changes how you trust it.

**Semantic drift detection.** When you change something, the system notices whether the *meaning* changed, not just the text. A typo fix and a conceptual revision are different events.

**Projections over transformations.** The same semantic graph can be viewed many ways—as a tree, a list, a set of questions. You do not transform data; you project it into different frames.

## The Deeper Purpose

XenoScript is an experiment in making the implicit explicit.

When we think, we manipulate meaning. But our tools manipulate text. XenoScript asks: what if the tool could see what we see? What if structure followed semantics instead of syntax?

This is not solved. It is being explored.

## What Lives Here

- The language parser and runtime (Deno/TypeScript)
- The REPL for interactive exploration
- Examples and tests
- A VS Code extension for editing `.xeno` files

## Status

XenoScript is experimental. The syntax may change. The semantics are still being discovered. Use it to think with, not to build production systems on.
